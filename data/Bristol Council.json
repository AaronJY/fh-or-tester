For example:\n \n\nHealth – the UK has the highest level of childhood obesity in Europe with one in five children obese by the time they leave primary school[i]. Just 15% of girls aged 11-15 and 22% of boys achieve the government recommended guidelines of an hour of moderate exercise each day[ii].\n\nExclusion – disabled people are four times more likely to be out of work than non-disabled people[iii] and only 18% of disabled people regularly engage in sport despite 70% wanting to[iv]. A 2017 UN inquiry concluded that the UK was not ensuring the UN Convention on Disabled People’s Rights.\n\nHardship – more than half of all children in the UK’s poorest areas are now growing up in poverty[v] and poverty is also experienced by nearly half of all families in which there is a disabled person[vi]\n\nSport is an incredibly powerful way to combat these issues and to transform the lives not only of deprived young people but also their families and surrounding communities. And yet, despite this, our most deprived communities are very often those most lacking in accessible sporting facilities.",

EFT is an amazing mind body technique with which you can release stuck negative emotions you might be holding on to within your energy system. It is often known as the emotional version of acupuncture but instead of using needles, you gently tap on meridian points on your head and body with your fingertips, while focusing on the negative emotion you wish to release. EFT is a remarkably quick, easy and effective way to resolve stress, anxiety, fears, phobias, trauma, performance issues, physical pain and much more!&nbsp;<br>EFT has completely transformed my life and my greatest wish now is to work with others to help them transform their lives too.</p>",

The aim is for a befriender to be matched with a client and to visit for approximately a 6 month period of time to listen and offer confidential emotional support, giving practical support in finding information and services locally and helping the individual to link up with ongoing support once the befriending period finishes. The befrienders have all had training involving sight loss awareness, listening skills, aspects of loss and grief, the impact of sight loss, safeguarding, etc. * This scheme is currently available in the BS3 area of Bristol only, but Torch Trust also has telephone befriending available for people in any area of the UK.

    "description": "<p>Bristol Autism Spectrum Service BASS Autism Services for Adults provide a service to adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) and professionals and carers who support them. What we do: Assess and diagnose people who are referred to us by their GP. Support colleagues in mental health services to assess and diagnose. Social support assessments to people who have been diagnosed by our team. Advice service with groups on mindfulness, managing anxiety, social cognition and interaction, as well as an opportunity to book one to one sessions with our staff (see details below). Post-diagnostic support - psycho-education, coping strategies and signposting. Training in Asperger syndrome and ASCs ranging from one hour awareness sessions to a full day's training. We are a small team and therefore do not have capacity to carry a caseload or do direct 1:1 support. We currently accept referrals for people within Bristol, North Somerset, BANES and South Gloucestershire. We run advice services for adults with autism diagnoses in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. Bristol&nbsp;autism advice service runs every Friday from 12.30 - 4.30pm at the Create Centre, Spike Island. It is open to people with autism spectrum conditions who live in the area. BaNES&nbsp;autism advice service runs every Wednesday afternoon from 1.00 - 5.00pm at the Percy Community Centre, Bath.

    "description": "<p>Bristol Autism Support Bristol Autism Support (BAS) is a not-for-profit Social Enterprise providing information, support and training for parents and carers of autistic children in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. What we do We create&nbsp;a wide range of opportunities&nbsp;for parents and carers of children with autism to connect with each other. Our strong community helps give&nbsp;parents and carers the knowledge needed&nbsp;to help them better support the children they look after. We provide&nbsp;clear, relevant information about autism to parents and carers. By doing so, we hope to improve the futures and outcomes of autistic children.&nbsp;We use this website, our&nbsp;Facebook page&nbsp;and&nbsp;email&nbsp;to signpost information about local and national services and support. As much as possible, we share the voices of autistic adults because we know they are best placed to teach us about our children. We work with local venues and attractions to make public places more accessible for families with autistic children. We provide volunteering and work experience opportunities that enable parents, carers and autistic young people to gain skills and improve confidence. Our structure BAS is&nbsp;an Unincorporated Association, which means we exist to serve the local autism family community. It also means any money that we raise or that is donated is spent solely on events, activities or things that will help families affected by autism in Bristol and surrounding areas. We have&nbsp;strong values. Our funding comes from private individual donations and grants. We have a core team of decision makers that runs the organisation. We are not a charity, and we are not council funded. This means we can act quickly to create new opportunities to support families with autistic children, either diagnosed or undiagnosed, regardless of the area where they live. For a full list of our 2019 support group meetings, please visit:&nbsp;https://www.bristolautismsupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BAS-2019-meetings-schedule.pdf https://www.bristolautismsupport.com/events/ https://www.facebook.com/bristolautismsupport/ http://eepurl.com/ds7Pw1 https://www.bristolautismsupport.com/about-us/bristol-autism-support-values/ https://www.bristolautismsupport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BAS-2019-meetings-schedule.pdf</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bristol Remap Remap is a very special charity, which works through 70+ local panels of volunteers, including the Bristol Panel. Each panel comprises engineers, craftsman and medical professionals. Remap provides custom made equipment and devices to help disabled people of all ages to improve their quality of life, enabling them to perform everyday tasks, or to pursue a hobby that was previously impossible for them. Please note that we do not carry a stock of aids, but that each aid is custom made to suit the client. Where commercially available aids are unsuitable, or simply do not exist, Remap can usually design and make, or adapt existing equipment, to produce a custom aid tailored to the needs of the client. Our services are provided free of charge. Each local panel is responsible for raising its own funds. We use these to buy materials, although many of our materials are donated, and we also recycle items we receive from a variety of sources. As all of our panel members are volunteers, our only expenses other than materials are travel and postage. We are therefore a very cost effective charity. Our cases range from simple household aids for people with poor strength in their limbs, to complex cases involving design and manufacturing challenges. The Bristol Remap Panel will take on cases from the area covered by Bristol City Council, South Gloucestershire Council, and North Somerset Council. If the client lives outside of this area, there will be another Remap Panel who will provide a service. We can in some circumstances cover some parts of the Bath area (BANES)</p>",

He loves scoring goals and being with his friends - we know this because he told us via Makaton Sign Language and recently, he has almost said my name!

We call this Shared Reading.\n\nWe read with schools, families and looked-after-children, adults in community spaces, people in care homes, people with physical and mental health conditions, those coping with or recovering from addiction, and people in the criminal justice system.\n\nEverything we do – from our global Shared Reading movement to the events, activities and social businesses on offer at Calderstones Park – builds warm and lively communities by bringing people together and books to life.",

If the person doesn’t have someone who can help them they have the right to have an independent Care Act advocate.</p><h3><br>Who can be supported by a Care Act advocate?</h3><p>Care Act advocates can support:</p><ul><li>Adults who need care and support</li><li>Carers</li><li>Children who are moving to adult care services</li></ul><p>If the council is making decisions about your care and support they must consider whether you would have ‘substantial difficulty’ being involved. Substantial difficulty would be if you have problems with one or more of these:</p><ul><li>Understanding information about the decisions</li><li>Remembering information</li><li>Using the information to be involved in the decisions</li><li>Being able to tell people your views, wishes and feeling</li></ul><p>The council then needs to consider whether you have an ‘appropriate individual’ to support you. This is someone who the council agree will be available and able to support you. It can be someone in your family or a friend but won’t be someone you don’t want to support you. It can’t be someone who is paid to look after you.</p><p>If the council decide that you would have substantial difficulty being involved and do not have an appropriate individual to support you, then you have the right to a Care Act advocate.</p><h3><br>How can a Care Act advocate help me?</h3><p>An advocate will support you to be involved as much as possible in decisions about your care. Your advocates can help you when the council is:</p><ul><li>Making a needs assessment</li><li>Making a carer’s assessment</li><li>Making or reviewing a care and support plan</li><li>Having a safeguarding enquiry (to check if you might be being abused) or arranging for a Safeguarding Adults Review</li></ul><p>Your advocate will work with you to help you understand what is happening and to give your views; they can speak for you if you can’t. Your advocate can help you to think about your choices and what is best for you. If you want to challenge the council’s decision your advocate can help you do this too.</p><p><br></p><h3>How do I get support from a Care Act advocate?</h3><p>Referrals are made through the local council.&nbsp;</p>",

Originally serving the Hartcliffe and Withywood areas of Bristol, it is now operating across South Bristol. The CATT service also provides transport to people in the community who need to get to and from South Bristol Community NHS Hospital in Hengrove. It ensures that the most vulnerable people in the community can access affordable transport, tackling isolation and enabling people to live independently. Our fleet of accessible vehicles includes 6 buses and 1 car. We run shuttle services, shopping trips, group hire, day trips and the South Bristol Hospital bus. We seek to ensure that some of the most vulnerable people in our area can go shopping, get to health appointments and participate in the social life of the community.</p>",

At that time I found my spiritual path, the Naqshbandi Sufi lineage, and my spiritual teacher Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee. This path, in combination with therapy, helped me to reconnect with myself.\n\nAfter that period I decided to train as a psychotherapist to help others. I chose to train in Core Process Psychotherapy because I believe any healing journey is a spiritual one, that must be undertaken with a psycho-spiritual approach. At the moment I am a Senior trainee psychotherapist, studying for accreditation at the Karuna Institute, and am offering these sessions whilst completing my training. I am fully insured, I am  UKCP and ACPP  registered and all my work in supervised according to professional and ethical requirements. \n\nPreviously, I worked as a designer for different companies while living in Spain, and also in the UK where I have been living for around a decade now. I can offer therapy sessions in both English and Spanish.\n\n I offer an 30 min intro session free of charge and affordable rate of £30 for an hour session.

That the space is open to all in the community and those attending range in age, ethnicity and faith. There is an area for toddlers, games for adults and a quiet space.</p>",

Do join us before this for our prayer meeting at 10:00 and refreshments at 10:30. Every other week, after the service, we have a meal together in the church building. See our calendar for more details.\n\nMid-week small groups are really important to us. These are great opportunities to meet together to study the Bible, pray and care for one another. These meet on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in different home across the city.\n\nDuring the week there are other opportunities to meet together and reach out to the local neighbourhood and city with the good news about Jesus.\n\nIf you’ve got any questions about Kensington or the Christian faith, please let us know by filling out the form below and someone will be in touch.",

    "description": "<p>creativeShift CIC creativeShiftCIC is one of the leading organisations in Bristol providing Arts on Referral programmes and creative wellbeing activities, to adults who are experiencing or are vulnerable to, isolation and mental health challenges. Together with our Bristol Arts on Referral Alliance (BARA) partners: Arts and Events Team Bristol City Council, Bristol Public Health, Fresh Arts, Knowle West Healthy Living Centre, Southmead Development Trust and Wellspring Healthy Living Centre, we deliver in areas of under representation, partnering with organisations working locally with marginalised people. Each programme and project is tailored to the particular community, ensuring we engage the most hard to reach people. creativeShift aims to: Improve wellbeing through involvement in arts activities Focus on those who are experiencing or vulnerable to isolation and mental health challenges Bring together different communities through the arts; using arts to create bridges between people, their communities and culture Develop collaborations with relevant organisations in response to need Continue to advance the practice of arts for wellbeing Our programmes connect individuals more with others and encourage them to take greater notice of the world around them; improve individuals’ wellbeing, self-esteem and confidence. The benefits of our work are that people become more active and engaged; share, give and work as part of a group; provide peer support and learn new skills. Participants are referred to our project by local organisations which work with vulnerable people experiencing a range of mental health challenges and health issues, and who are in need of support. For example: homeless people living in supported housing people recovering from drug and alcohol addiction people with mental illness women affected by domestic violence, post-natal depression and other support issues. adults through the social prescribing remit Our projects offer an opportunity to both individuals and the referring organisations, to further progress an individual’s recovery/progression plan through creative activity and help them to engage with wider society by attending a new venue, meet new people, provide peer support and learn new skills. Typically our programmes offer participants weekly 2 hour group workshops for up to 18 sessions. These relaxed and friendly art sessions are led by an artist with a background in socially engaged practice and experienced in facilitating Arts on Referral groups. Participants are gently introduced to a range of ideas and techniques to help them explore their own creativity and learn new skills at their own pace. No previous arts experience is necessary. Sessions are focused on arts and wellbeing and are different to counselling or therapy. The workshops are based in community hubs and connect with the wider social prescribing network.

YOUR WARDROBES, CUPBOARDS, DRAWERS AND SHELVES FULL TO BURSTING POINT?</p><p>Do you have an overflow of clutter and do not have the time or the energy to sort it out?</p><p>Decluttering is not about making a 'show home' but managing your belongings so that you can enjoy them in a safe, clean environment.</p><p>COLLECTING&nbsp;AND HOARDING: It is human nature to collect things. Belongings are part of our identity and bring much joy and happiness. Holiday mementos, photographs, ornaments, pictures, clothes, books etc. They all say something about your personality and are to be treasured.&nbsp;Yet when collecting&nbsp;takes over your home&nbsp;it can become a problem that causes irritation, worry and frustration.</p><p>DEALING WITH BEREAVEMENT, ILLNESS, DIVORCE OR A RELATIVES HOUSE: These are extremely emotional and difficult times. I am there to support you&nbsp;to reduce the workload and to achieve&nbsp;positive solutions and&nbsp;ways of moving forward.</p><p>MOVING HOUSE: Decluttering your&nbsp;property before putting it on the market can increase the&nbsp;selling price&nbsp;enormously and stops you importing clutter into your new home. It presents your property in the best possible light and maximises its full selling&nbsp;potential.</p><p>HOUSE NOT SELLING. LOW OFFERS. POOR VIEWINGS: The first time a buyer sees your property is usually online,&nbsp;so images need to be eye catching and enticing.&nbsp;Removing clutter and making&nbsp;use of&nbsp;the house doctor and maintenance/handyman&nbsp;service&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;attract buyers and create sales.</p><p>Decluttering and reorganising your home declutters the mind. It&nbsp;reduces anxiety and stress levels by making your home an inviting, pleasurable place to live in and somewhere to&nbsp;feel proud of. The task may seem&nbsp;daunting and sometimes overwhelming therefore&nbsp;I&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a tailor made service to suit your needs.</p><p>Free consultation.</p><p>Morning or afternoon sessions.</p><p>DBS checked.</p><p>Full public liability insurance.</p><p>Ethical recycling and accountable waste disposal.</p><p>Recycling by donations to charity, through second hand markets&nbsp;and appropriate organisations.</p><p>Handyman/maintenance&nbsp;Service.</p><p>Recommendations for electricians, plumbers, carpenters, decorators, roofers, gardeners&nbsp;etc&nbsp;</p><p>Confidential paperwork shredding service.</p><p>Advice and solutions.</p><p>Privacy and confidentiality assured.</p><p>There is no pressure, you are in control, I work with you at your pace with empathy and understanding.

It causes the nerves in the arms and legs to become inflamed and stop working, usually leading to temporary paralysis.\nAn estimated 1-2 people per 100,000 are affected by GBS annually in the UK with a further 0.5-1 per 100,000 being diagnosed with CIDP, which is a similar but longer-lasting condition. About 80% of those with GBS will make a good recovery, but unfortunately between 5-10% of people will not survive and the other 10-15% may experience long term residual effects ranging from limited mobility or dexterity, to life-long dependency on a wheelchair.\nGAIN is the only national organisation in the UK and Republic of Ireland dedicated to supporting people affected by these conditions.\nWhat we do:\n• Help people understand and manage GBS, CIDP and the associated variants\n• Promote and facilitate both clinical and non-clinical research\n• Raise awareness of the charity and conditions\n",

This reflects the special interest of the trans people in the charity's membership. GIRES is concerned that society often treats this particular group harshly. This includes shortcomings in the provision of medical services.\nGIRES' primary mission is to improve the circumstances in which trans people live, by changing the way that society treats them. Accordingly, its aim is to generate supportive attitudes among all those who can make those improvements happen, including politicians, other policy makers, clinicians, the providers of commercial and government services including the police, teachers, employers, and journalists, as well as other family members. GIRES' approach is based on research both into the origins of atypical gender identity development and transsexualism and, also, into the way that society reacts to the people experiencing these conditions. It develops good practice guidelines, education programmes and literature, all specially tailored for each of the groups that it aims to influence.\n",

For use after an operation. Suitable for anyone wanting to work extremely gently. For use on the not so good low energy days.</p><p>It begins with your breath, learning the fundamentals of breath control-learning the power of correct breathing. If you learn how to control your breath, you can influence how you feel emotionally and physically. Deeper and smoother breathing slows your heartbeat, reduces the flow of adrenalin and increases the flow of endorphinns, your body's natural tranquilliser. Yoga means 'union' or balance', it works on the physical body, the mind and the emotions. The programme can be done lying on a bed or the floor. It will target what you can do rather than what you can't. Listen to your body, work at your own pace. Fees: Contact for details</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Golden-Oldies Charity, more fondly referred to as ‘Goldies’, was founded by Bath-based musician Grenville Jones in 2007. For many years Grenville had built a reputation as one of the UK’s foremost choir leaders and had learnt first-hand of the positive social effects of singing in a choir or a music group.<br>&nbsp;<br>“I wanted to grab the atmosphere of fun and friendship and bring it to older isolated people through daytime ‘singalongs’ of the memory-evoking hits of the 60s and onwards.”<br>&nbsp;<br>Grenville himself took the first four sessions in and around Bath and Bristol in 2008 and is always quick to point out that his Charity is&nbsp;<u>NOT</u>&nbsp;about choir singing.<br>&nbsp;<br>“Goldies gives older isolated people&nbsp;<strong>something to look forward to</strong>, a chance to get out, make new friends and singalong to those popular hits of the past.”<br>&nbsp;<br>From small beginnings, and with Sir Cliff Richard as Patron, the work of the Charity has grown across England and Wales (Goldies Cymru) and, prior to Lockdown, in March 2020 there were over 200 daytime fun singalong Goldies sessions. These sessions took place in Libraries, community rooms and Church halls and were led by dedicated session leaders from various backgrounds, all with one thing in common – they shared the common view that singing together made you feel better and always brought a smile!<br>&nbsp;<br>Those attending the sessions were older people living in community housing, adults with learning difficulties and people living with dementia – everyone is welcome at a Goldies session.<br>&nbsp;<br>Over the years the Charity has received considerable support from many philanthropic Trusts, Local Authorities, Organisations and the National Lottery in both England and Wales. There has also been considerable media coverage of Goldies over the years and, most recently, the popular ITV soap Emmerdale featured Goldies during its commercial breaks. This was made possible with the support of the People’s Postcode Lottery Community Fund.<br>&nbsp;<br>Academic studies have also endorsed the benefits that the Golden-Oldies Charity brings to older people – these can be accessed through the website.<br>&nbsp;<br>Goldies has also worked with Primary Schools in recent years with support from the Lottery Heritage Fund and in 2018 received the accolade of winning the Education Category of the National Lottery Awards – a project based on the music of the First World War! the award being presented to Grenville by Katherine Jenkins.<br>&nbsp;<br>Forced by Covid to close all sessions, Goldies looked to the internet, Facebook and YouTube to bring its fun sessions to people in their homes. Popular Wales-based leaders Rachel Parry and Cheryl Davies lead the twice-weekly sessions under the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.goldieslive.com/\" href=\"http://www.goldieslive.com/\">www.goldieslive.com</a>&nbsp;banner, with people joining from their homes across the United Kingdom. As the country emerges from Lockdown plans are in place to reintroduce the Goldies sessions that were forced to close and also to introduce more sessions in both England and Wales. This will be in partnership with the many organisations and community groups with whom a close working relationship has been forged in recent years.<br><br></p>",

    "description": "Happy City\nHappy City exists to demonstrate that being happier needn’t cost the earth. The world needs a new story: less ‘stuff for stuff’s sake’ and more ‘life for life’s sake’. A story that redefines what it means to prosper. We believe that story is unfolding all around us.\nOurs is a radically simple plan to grow happiness – one city at a time - by helping people LIVE MORE, SHARE MORE, and ENJOY LIFE, FOR LESS. Happy City is a sophisticated project, working at all levels, from the grass-roots of small community groups to the high table of national strategists. Activities include campaigning & communication, projects, training, events and the development of better measures of prosperity. Each element supports the others – anything less simply won't work.\nCities are shaped by the people who live there - the way they think and act. So to serve up happiness at a city scale, we need to tap into the wisdom that's already there. Our approach is to ask, to encourage, to share, to support and to offer a helping hand. We work in partnership wherever possible so people can build on each others' success and learn to flourish together.\nEvening classes available - contact for details.\n",

They are also trained to perform hearing aid maintenance for those who are unable to visit the NHS Audiology Department. The scheme does not replace their service, but enhances the support given. <br></p><p>If you live in Bristol, South Gloucestershire or North Somerset and need help with your hearing aids, the best option is to contact your hearing aid provider.

If your concern is about a service provided by an NHS Trust (hospitals, mental health services, community health services and ambulance services) you can contact their Patient Advice &amp; Liaison Service (PALS). PALS (which may also be known as Patient Experience or Service Experience services) can help you resolve your concerns quickly and without having to make a formal complaint.

If the NHS paid for treatment at a private hospital or pays all or part of someone’s care home fees this is also covered by the NHS complaints process.</p><p>You can complain about your own care and treatment or someone else’s but you may need to get their consent before the NHS will investigate.</p><p>If you have done everything you can to resolve your complaint with the local service and you are not happy with their final decision you can contact the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/making-complaint/complain-us-getting-started\" href=\"https://www.ombudsman.org.uk/making-complaint/complain-us-getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parliamentary &amp; Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO)</a>.

    "description": "<h3>What is an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)?</h3><p>An IMCA is an advocate who has been specially trained to support people who are not able to make certain decisions for themselves and do not have family or friends who are able to speak for them. IMCAs do not make decisions and they are independent of the people who do make the decisions.</p><p>An IMCA can support anyone who is over 16 years old and who has been assessed as ‘lacking capacity’. This means they are not able to make or understand a particular decision about their life because the way their mind or brain works has been affected by an illness, an injury or a disability. They must have been assessed by a doctor or a social worker at the time the particular decision needs to be made. The person might have dementia, learning disabilities, mental health problems, a brain injury or they might have had a stroke. A lack of capacity can be temporary such as when someone has been in an accident and is unconscious.</p><h3><br>When can an IMCA be instructed?</h3><p>An IMCA can be instructed (asked to represent a person) when a decision needs to be made about:</p><ul><li>Serious medical treatment - when the NHS wants to give new treatment, stop treatment that is already being given or when they do not want to start treatment or</li><li>A&nbsp;change of accommodation - when the NHS or local council wants to move a person to hospital for more than 28 days or to other accommodation for more than 8 weeks.</li></ul><p>It&nbsp;should also be considered whether it would be helpful for an IMCA to be instructed for two other issues:</p><ul><li>Safeguarding Adults from Abuse<em>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</em>when the NHS or local council receives a report of abuse and either the person reported to have been abused or reported to be the abuser lacks capacity to understand the plans being made to prevent the abuse. This is the only type of issue where the person can have family or friends to support them and still have IMCA support.&nbsp;</li><li>Care&nbsp;Reviews<em>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</em>when the NHS or local council has arranged accommodation or wants to review arrangements for a person who lacks capacity.</li></ul><h3><br>What is the role of an IMCA?</h3><p>POhWER’s IMCAs find out as much as possible about the views and beliefs of the person referred to them. They have the right to meet the person privately and to see their health and care records. An IMCA considers all relevant information about the person then writes a report to help decision-makers reach decisions which are in the best interests of the person. Sometimes they might look at options which were not suggested by the professional or ask for a second medical opinion. An IMCA has the right to challenge any decision made.</p><h3><br>What is the Court of Protection?</h3><p>The Court of Protection is a special court which looks at cases about people who lack capacity to make decisions. If a very serious decision needs to be made it might be sent to the Court of Protection. The court makes decisions and appoints people called deputies who can act for someone who is not able to make decisions about their personal health, finance or welfare.</p>",

Based in Bristol, have monthly meetings and have approximately seventy members who build a great variety of models including aircraft (both civil and military) ships, cars, armoured vehicles and figures.\nThe club is a wealth of information on all aspects of the hobby - members are always ready to answer questions and give help and advice.\n\nWe hold our own annual show (and have done for the last 25 years). Now held in conjunction with Lincombe Barn Wargames Society, we invite clubs and traders from both modelling and wargaming genres to take part in an event that is widely regarded as the best one-day modelling show on the calendar. We also exhibit at many model shows throughout the year.\nWe all try to bring not just finished models on club night but also models in progress - not everybody is an expert and seeing just how someone builds a model can be interesting and thought provoking.\nWe have guest speakers and model competitions as well as practical demonstrations - and plenty of time to chat about our hobby over a glass of our favourite drink, and set the world of modelling right...\nMeetings are held on the 3rd Wednesday in the month from 7:30pm for 8.00pm.\n",

Lighthouse offers an enhanced service to vulnerable, intimated or persistently targeted victims of crime and anti-social behaviour, and victims of serious crime.&nbsp; To find out more about that this means and who is classed as an enhanced victim take a look at:&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/470212/code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime.PDF\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/470212/code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime.PDF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Victim Code of Practice</a></p><p>If you are currently receiving support from Lighthouse and have misplaced the contact details of your allocated Victim and Witness Care Officer you can contact us via 101.</p>",

Luv2meetU organises activities and events within the community which members can attend, through which they can meet new people, develop friendship networks and gain confidence in accessing the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> We try to organise the events which&nbsp;our members tell us they want, so there’s always something different to try. Examples of events might be: theatre, cinema, bowling, sports,&nbsp;walks, club nights, karaoke, gaming, meals out, cafes, picnics, workshops, shopping and day trips. There are approximately 10-12 events/activities each month for members to choose from.</p><p><strong>Dating:</strong> If&nbsp;interested in dating and relationships, members can be matched up with other members based upon their interests, or can request dates with other members who they meet through our events.&nbsp;If both members want to meet up then we set up a date based upon what they would like to do. All first dates are chaperoned by a trained member of staff or volunteers.&nbsp;Luv2meetU make follow-up calls after each first date to see how things have gone.&nbsp;Luv2meetU will also sometimes&nbsp;run singles&nbsp;events or&nbsp;speed dating as requested.</p><p><strong>Costs:</strong> Members pay £10 per month membership fee. This will include access to our online events, receiving an events flyer every month and support from Luv2meetU. Attending face-to-face events are charged on a pay-as-you-go basis so that members will only pay for the events which they&nbsp;attend. Luv2meetU&nbsp;charges&nbsp;£5 per hour for each event e.g. a one-hour cafe meet-up would cost £5, where a 3-hour cinema event would&nbsp;cost&nbsp;£15. Members&nbsp;will pay for their own costs at an event or activity (e.g. food, drinks, transport, cinema tickets etc.). There will be a £5 charge for dates. Luv2meetU is a Community Interest Company and all fees are used to pay for our running costs.</p><p>Luv2MeetU is run by HFT -&nbsp; a national charity providing services for people with learning disabilities.

The project aims to support clients to reach their individual goals, increase mental wellbeing and help make the home safer and more suitable for their needs. Making space offers an empathetic and supportive environment to people living with hoarding tendencies, and aspires to empower individuals to sustainably 'make space' not only in their home, but also their life and mind; increasing the confidence, wellbeing and self-efficacy of those we support. &nbsp;This is an approach that is proven to be successful and far more effective than other alternatives such as, where applicable, statutory or landlord intervention. The project is currently offered 'free of charge' and is led by trained volunteers across Bath &amp; north East Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. &nbsp;At this time we only support home owners and private tenants. &nbsp;Due to the high demand&nbsp; we cannot support individuals with either complex or low level hoarding tendencies. &nbsp;For more information on alternative support agencies please visit&nbsp;www.hoardingdisordersuk.org&nbsp;or www.hoardinguk.org For information on how to make a referral please check our website.

We promote self-determination in order to prevent service users from becoming institutionalised and over-dependent. Our ultimate objective is to encourage and enable clients to move on and live completely independent lives in the community when they are ready and likely to succeed. We help all clients to develop their own person-centered support plans which have clearly stated objectives and outcomes and are regularly assessed and updated to ensure the support we provide is appropriate to their needs. Maples provide an extensive range of supported accommodation throughout Bristol and South Gloucestershire in shared houses for up to six people or self-contained flats for those who require less support, or as a move-on opportunity as clients progress through our service. Support is provided during the day and early evenings when our team of highly skilled and dedicated support staff assist clients with independent living skills such as budgeting, meal planning, shopping, hygiene, medication management, activities from their care plan and general emotional support. We do not provide personal or medical care but that can be arranged through our partner agencies if required. Some locations have sleep-in night staff and telephone support with a security call-out is available in other locations in the event of emergencies arising outside of normal staff working hours.

    "description": "Marmalade Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Vision\nWe are committed to playing a key role in delivering the following vision:\n\n“To create a society where people freely acknowledge that loneliness can exist, and will actively support those experiencing it to increase their social contact and make new friendships.”\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to find and support isolated people to reconnect with society and enjoy better lives. We do this through a 4-stage process:\n\n1. Identify lonely people through an established referral network.\n2. Actively raise awareness about loneliness to reduce the stigma, encourage people who experience it to come forward and influence positive action to alleviate it. We have launched the UK’s first Loneliness Awareness Week.\n3. Support those isolated in our region to attend our Christmas Day event, to reacquaint them with socialising/making friends.\n4. Run friendship projects that include one to one support to help them build confidence and make their own friends, join clubs and generally reach out to the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we do\nWe offer a vital link between lonely people and the communities and resources that can help them. We have two bi-annual events: our Christmas Day Lunch and Loneliness Awareness Week, which is held in June. We are also currently trialling our first Buddy Scheme, which connects volunteers with people experiencing loneliness. We raise awareness of loneliness all year round to help people to reach out and make positive changes within their own\nlives and communities.\n\nIn a nutshell:\nWHAT: We recognise and raise awareness of loneliness\nHOW: We support and signpost people to new resources and communities\nWHY: To empower people to make new friendships and connections\nOur Values\nWe are a predominantly volunteer led organisation, and each member of our ‘family’ supports and embodies our core set of values:\n\nEveryone associated with Marmalade Trust will, through their behaviours and communications, demonstrate integrity, respect and understanding and a commitment and enthusiasm to challenging loneliness.\nWe are collectively determined to reduce the stigma of loneliness, so that no one is ashamed to say they are lonely.\nWe are inclusive, supportive and value community connections.\nWe do not discriminate on any basis.\nWe are committed to building a sustainable organisation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Manifesto\nWe see ourselves as the friendly face of loneliness and we believe in the power of the everyday person. We have a positive and proactive approach to loneliness and we want to normalise the conversation around it. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely: it’s just a lack of social connections. We aim to lose the stigma around loneliness and rather than seeing it as a negative, shameful or hopeless thing, we want to educate people to see loneliness as a blank canvas on which they can fill their lives with new friends and experiences. We all feel lonely at some point but the good news is that it is entirely fixable. We are committed to changing the language of loneliness to make it a conversation about connections instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Men’s Aid strives to remove bias and prejudice from all parts of our Society and focuses on providing help and assistance to anyone, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, who may need it, but in particular males.</p><p><strong>A Gender Inclusive Organisation</strong></p><p>Over many years Men’s Aid has undertaken an active Campaign for Equality within our Society to help re-balance many stereotypical views, particularly those held about men. These, often negative views, include male issues relating to parenting, fatherhood, domestic abuse and violence. Government now recognise that abuse can occur in any personal relationship, or any situation where a service is being given, including formal or informal caregivers, or by a person who has power or influence over the life of a dependent adult. Domestic Violence and Abuse is now recognised as a gender neutral issue by many organisations, with violence and abuse against men identified as the ‘last taboo’ which needs to be urgently addressed.</p><p><strong>Men’s Aid&nbsp;Charity</strong></p><p>Also works in partnership with other organisations to promote and raise awareness of other issues relating to men’s welfare in general. Men’s Aid is active and concerned with the levels of homelessness, suicide, false allegations of domestic abuse and sexual offences, Family Law, PTSD and mental health issues, and the general wellbeing of any concern which relates to men, their families and children.</p><p><strong>Working with Families and Children</strong></p><p>Within the arena of Family Court the charity provides information and advice to all parents who are seeking to maintain a meaningful and responsible relationship with their children after family break down or divorce. &nbsp;We aim to assist these parents in their endeavours to achieve equal and just treatment in the Family Courts and from their associated services. We recognise the value of good parenting and support parents who work together for and in the best interests of their children.</p><p><strong>Constitution and Objectives</strong></p><p>1. To relieve the hardship, distress and suffering of male victims (and their families) of domestic abuse in such ways as the charity shall decide from time to time.</p><p>2. &nbsp;The protection and preservation of men’s health (both physical and mental) in such ways as the trustees thinks fit and lawful.</p><p>3. &nbsp;To advance the education of the public in matters relating to domestic abuse in order to raise awareness of the the needs of abuse victims and to undertake whenever necessary the prevention and discrimination against males on the grounds of sex so far as such discrimination is unlawful.</p>",

So whether it is talking to someone, sharing with them or simply walking beside them, we believe that getting connected is the first steps to recovery.\n\n\n\nAt MHM, we support you in creating community groups, that not only help others, but also help you. Building a support group is a wonderful way for you to recognise just how capable you are, despite what your head might be telling you. We believe that finding power over your experience allows you to challenge and take back some control over that stuff in your head.",

Our groups provide much needed support to women and can improve the lives of the children who attend.

This process of change and finding a new normal, is full of wonderful and challenging moments. For some however, this conflict and change, alongside perhaps life stresses or distressing experiences can pose barriers to adjusting and tolerating difficult feelings such as anxiety, loss and isolation etc.</p><p><strong>Why we may wish to think about accessing therapy…</strong></p><p>If you feel that your mental health is impacting on your enjoyment of relationships, bonding with your baby/children, personality, and everyday activities or interests, you may wish to seek some support. Speaking with a psychotherapist or counsellor in a safe, non-judgemental environment can enable us to develop clearer understanding of and abilities to cope with difficult feelings. Many families have benefitted and made meaningful changes in their lives as a result of utilising the therapeutic services at Mothers for Mothers.</p><p><strong>What’s on offer:</strong></p><p>All of our therapies are:</p><ul><li>Person-centred – we believe that the client’s experiences &amp; needs are individual to them. The therapy relationship is based on honesty, respect, compassion and equality.</li><li>Low-cost – clients are asked to donate a weekly amount affordable for them.</li><li>Short-term – we offer a minimum of six sessions with the potential to extend.</li><li>One to one – the client and therapist can meet either face-to-face or via zoom</li><li>Confidential<br><br></li></ul></section><section id=\"group-trips\"><h4>GROUP TRIPS</h4><p>We have for group events a year. Two trips to local family attractions and two parties. These events provide an opportunity to build your social circle outside the group you attend and give all the children a wonderful fun day. This can help self-esteem and build confidence, being away from home with the safety of our support and the support of our play workers.</p><p>The women attending the groups decide on the location, usually a local attraction such as Avon Valley Country Park, Bristol Zoo and We the Curious.

It can help support clients to take ownership of their experiences and change in their view of current challenges they may face. The art psychotherapists offer clients non-judgemental and compassionate support through the process. Some clients can feel nervous about using the art materials, perhaps because they aren’t familiar with them or fear that they are not good enough, however many find that they build in confidence and enjoyment using the materials and some continue using these new skills after the therapy has ended.</p></section><section id=\"counselling\"><h4>COUNSELLING</h4><p>Counselling is a talking therapy that involves a counsellor listening to and supporting a client whilst helping them find ways to deal with personal issues. Clients are encouraged to talk about their thoughts and feelings with the counsellor, who will listen and support without judgement or criticism.

Large collections often take place as part of Harvest Festival celebrations and&nbsp;food is also collected at supermarkets.</p><h3>FOOD IS SORTED AND STORED</h3><p>Volunteers sort food to check that it’s in date and pack it into boxes ready to be given to people in need. Over 40,000 people give up their time to volunteer at foodbanks.</p><h3>PROFESSIONALS IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN NEED</h3><p>Foodbanks partner with a wide range of care professionals such as doctors, health visitors, social workers and police to identify people in crisis and issue them with a foodbank voucher.</p><h3>CLIENTS RECEIVE FOOD</h3><p>Foodbank clients bring their voucher to a foodbank centre where it can be redeemed for three days’ emergency food. Volunteers meet clients over a warm drink or free hot meal and are able to signpost people to agencies able to solve the longer-term problem.</p>",

You are likely to experience a lot of different emotions when your sibling has a mental illness, from sadness, shock and worry, to anger, fear and guilt. Some siblings also feel worried or guilty about the emotions they are feeling, and are not sure where to turn for advice and reassurance. Talking to other siblings about your experiences can really help. We hold meetings once a month where you can come together and meet other siblings in a similar situation. It’s up to you how much or little you talk, but you can feel sure there will people here who want to listen and share their experiences with you.</p>",

For others, the prospect of riding a bike, and the confidence, strength and wide-eyed enjoyment it can bring, may be a new prospect. In either case, RORO’s cycle outreach service is about bringing riding to those who would otherwise be unable to ride themselves – and to open up for them all the life-giving, life-affirming benefits cycling can bring.<br></p>",

We hope all ages and abilities can get involved with the garden tasks, and if you come along you are welcome to take a share of the produce that we pick that day. We always leave plenty of time for chat, so bring along a drink and join in. Occasionally we might be shut for poor weather or lack of volunteer leaders so do check if it's the first time you are coming.<br></p><p>We love visitors when we are open who just want to enjoy the surroundings and the chat. All ages are welcome to these sessions and we are always very happy to get out toys for our digging bed and mud kitchen. Our young families session on a Monday mornings is lots of fun and very popular, and currently has a waiting list. We put on regular events throughout the year including children's craft activities, the occasional weekend work party and the annual harvest lunch.

      "description": "Sight Support is a registered charity that works with visually impaired people and their families across Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire, Swindon and Wiltshire. Our aim is to ensure that people living with a visual impairment across the West of England can lead active and fulfilled lives.  \n \nThe charity was established in April 2018 (previously as Vision West of England) through a collaboration between the Thomas Pocklington Trust and Wiltshire Sight, in response to a needs assessment which showed that people in Bristol, Bath and South Gloucestershire living with sight loss did not have access to appropriate local support services.  In the absence of any local sight loss charity in the area, the new charity was formed to build local services which are driven by the needs of blind and partially sighted people and which fill an established gap in service provision.\n\nSight Support staff now operate from two hubs, in Bristol and Devizes in Wiltshire, where we continue to work under the banner of Wiltshire Sight.\n\nOur dedicated team can provide the answers to your questions; signpost you to support groups, offer advice for family and carers or make a referral for you to access support from one of our partner organisations.  If you or someone you know is visually impaired, we’re here to help.",

    "description": "<p>Re-engage (formerly Contact The Elderly) - Sunday Afternoon Tea Parties Re-engage (formerly Contact The Elderly) is the only national charity solely dedicated to tackling loneliness and social isolation among older people through face to face contact. Supported by a network of volunteers, the charity organises free monthly Sunday afternoon tea parties for small groups of older people, aged 75 and over, who live alone. Offering a regular and vital friendship link every month. Each older person is collected from their home by a volunteer driver and taken to a volunteer host’s home for the afternoon. The group is warmly welcomed by a different host each month, but the drivers remain the same which means that over the months and years, acquaintances turn into friends and loneliness is replaced by companionship. Our tea parties are a real lifeline of friendship for our older guests who have little or no contact with family or friends. They bring people of all ages together, develop fulfilling friendships and support networks, while giving everyone involved something to look forward to each month. Tea parties are held in different locations across Bristol and South Gloucestershire. To find your nearest group please contact Regional Development Office Helen Ker-Bridges. For more information about volunteering with us please see here https://www.reengage.org.uk/volunteer/volunteer-opportunities/</p>",

    "description": "<p>We are very pleased to announce that the Tai Chi class for Bristol Parkinson’s group will be re-starting in September 2021. I will be running the class alongside Sarah B. from&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.buqiworks.co.uk/index\" href=\"https://www.buqiworks.co.uk/index\">Buqi Works</a>. Sarah has been teaching the Parkinsons’s group for a number of years already and has a huge amount of knowledge and experience, not just about Tai Chi &amp; Qi Gong, but about how best to teach to help<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/\" href=\"https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/\">&nbsp;Parkinson’s</a>&nbsp;sufferers and people with long term health conditions. If you haven’t done Tai Chi or Qi Gong before, come along and give it a go. We look forward to meeting you.</p><h2>When and Where:</h2><p id=\"Taichiparkinsons\"><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.downendfolkhouse.org.uk/\" href=\"https://www.downendfolkhouse.org.uk/\">Lincombe Barn, Downend Folk House.</a>&nbsp;Fridays in school terms. 10.15 – 12.15 (Includes tea/coffee break).</p><h2>What does a Tai Chi class for Parkinson’s involve?</h2><p>This is a gentle Tai Chi &amp; Qi Gong class aimed specifically at helping you if you have Parkinson’s disease. We also welcome carers and family members. The class includes standing exercises from the&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.taichibodyandmind.co.uk/taijiwuxigong/\" href=\"https://www.taichibodyandmind.co.uk/taijiwuxigong/\">Taijiwuxigong</a>&nbsp;system, and we adapt these for you if you need to sit. We also teach some simple&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.taichibodyandmind.co.uk/taiji-37/\" href=\"https://www.taichibodyandmind.co.uk/taiji-37/\">Tai Chi form</a>. This is adapted for people with balance and mobility problems. If you do not have Parkinson’s, but you have mobility and balance issues, and/or a chronic health condition, this class may also be suitable for you.</p><h2>A chance to share:</h2><p>There are two 45 minute sessions, with a half hour break for tea and coffee. Our participants really value the chance to sit down and chat between the sessions. Over the years, this has become a really important part of the session. Talking to other people who are going through the same thing as you is so valuable when you have a long-term health condition. These sessions have helped our participants to make new and lasting friendships.</p><h2>Cost:</h2><p>The class is kindly supported by Bristol Parkinson’s. This means that we can run the class at a reduced cost so you only need to pay £7.00 for a 2 hour session.</p><h2>Safety</h2><p>This class has been reviewed and there is a Covid secure risk assessment. You can participate safe in the knowledge that we are following Government guidelines on Covid-secure teaching practises.</p>",

People can obtain reassurance night and day when they are feeling particularly anxious or in need of help. This service is invaluable to those with mobility and health problems. It enables people to to continue living at home independently. &nbsp;The system&nbsp;can be installed using an existing phone line.&nbsp; If there is no phone line we can provide a unit which uses mobile networks.&nbsp; A lightweight pendant or wrist button is provided which&nbsp;allows the wearer&nbsp;to call for assistance from anywhere in the home. &nbsp;The system is linked to a monitoring centre which is staffed 24/7 by a team of professionals. The Council’s own Responder Service can attend in some circumstances if there are no relatives or other contacts available.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can apply for the Service; there is no need for a Social Care assessment.</p><p>Wireless sensors can also be linked to the lifeline system and these will trigger an automatic alert if there is a problem in the home.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><p>Examples additional sensors:</p><p>Smoke alarm - the Control Centre will contact the Fire Service immediately if there is smoke in the property.&nbsp;</p><p>Fall detector – this device detects sudden impact&nbsp;and after 20&nbsp;seconds will activate an alert to the monitoring centre. &nbsp;</p><p>Temperature extreme sensor – triggers an alert if the house becomes too hot or cold.</p><p>Property exit sensor – placed on&nbsp;a front or back door, this checks for people leaving a building at unusual times of the day or night.</p><p>Bed sensors - to alert if the person has left the bed for longer than expected</p><p>&nbsp;Fees: Please enquire for details as cost depends on level of service.</p>",

To love. To understand. To empower. To support. In the centre of our ‘tree’ logo is the word ‘love’, written in Chinese, to depict branches of compassion reaching out to people in their time of need.\n\nThe simple and compassionate act of giving people food on a weekly basis has created a safe and positive environment to build relationship and gain an understanding of each person’s circumstances. This allows us to engage on a much deeper level - to get to the heart of the problem, and then support people to move from crisis to independence in the best possible way.",

The hours our volunteers give enrich the lives and wellbeing of the people we support through conversation, laughter, shared experiences and encouraging their independence. Taking the time to build a rapport with someone reaps many rewards for them and for you.</p><p>You won’t just be supporting someone with a learning disability, mental health need or dementia.

As a volunteer, you could be supporting someone in their homes, to get involved in activities like baking, gardening, arts and crafts or improving their computer skills.
