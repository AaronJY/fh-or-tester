Since the gallery’s doors first opened in 2001 we have developed a reputation for offering a varied and exciting exhibition programme of contemporary art, craft and design.  We show around 20 exhibitions per year, across six exhibition spaces, and aim to be as ambitious and creatively diverse.  As well as bringing arts and culture to the local community, we aim to exhibit art by groups that are traditionally under represented in mainstream galleries.\n\nEncompassing a wide range of media, subjects and artistic approaches, we present a mixture of in-house curated exhibitions, touring shows and exhibitions developed in partnership with fellow creative organisations.  We also produce and deliver our own touring exhibitions to other galleries nationally, and offer an extensive education programme for all ages and abilities.\n\nWe’re an Arts Council England [National Portfolio Organisation (NPO] which means funding thanks to tax payers and National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.",

While this is the worst-case scenario, there are many ways in which eating disorders severely affect the quality of life of both those suffering and those who care about them. They steal childhoods, devastate relationships and pull families apart.

People can contact us online or by phone 365 days a year. We listen to them, help them to understand the illness, and support them to take positive steps towards recovery. We also support family and friends, equipping them with essential skills and advice, so they can help their loved ones recover whilst also looking after their own mental health. And we campaign to increase knowledge among healthcare and other relevant professionals, and for better funding for high-quality treatment, so that when people are brave enough to take vital steps towards recovery, the right help is available to them.</p><p>The work we do means that every year lives are saved, families are kept together, and people are able to live free of eating disorders.</p><h3 id=\"our-values\">Our Values</h3><p>We share the vision of an end to the pain and suffering caused by eating disorders.

The class is done to some great music and is a fun way to work out. There are many benefits to these classes such as there is an average calorie burn in a 45 minute class of between 450 to 600.&nbsp; Benefits include:</p><ul><li>Improved balance, coordination and posture</li><li>Enhanced digestion</li><li>Improved metabolism</li><li>Lower blood pressure</li><li>Arthritis management</li><li>Supports the pelvic floor</li></ul><p>and much more!</p><p><em>Please note that because of the number of trampolines available at each venue classes have to be booked through the Gymcatch app on the link provided and that there is a 48 hour cancellation period.</em></p>",

      "description": "I have been teaching different classes at many different gyms, fitness centres and other venues for over 35 years now. I started fitness quite late on in life doing the initial training with my daughter as she didn’t want to do it on her own and from then on I was hooked and have never looked back.\n\nWell firstly my participants are my priority and I understand that to enjoy a class you need to feel welcome and safe; you need to know its ok if the class is moving in one direction and you’re going in the other its fine. Everybody does it so you’re not the first and won’t be the last.\n\nI think my classes have been popular for so many years is because they are fun, hey even I go wrong but we can laugh about it.\n\nIts important you work at a level that feels good for you and you are in an environment that allows this.\n\nI know there are barriers to fitness for many people but hopefully the classes can help remove some of those for you and leave you feeling empowered and crush any doubts you may had about yourself and abilities.",

We are no longer aligned to our values and even when we start to notice this; it just seems to create even more discord and our inner critic has a field day!\nSometimes just stepping completely away from the normality of life, gives us the chance to just pause and breathe.\nIt gives us the opportunity to reflect and restore.\nTo reconnect to what is important and of value in our lives.\nThe added bonus is that these nourishing days, always seem to attract like minded souls.\nPeople who you can really connect and converse with deeply and with intention.\n\nEach wellbeing day has a different offering.\nSingle day immersions  invite you to experience a deeper connection with nature and your true nature.\n\nWeekends are about real time for you. They are a true opportunity to pause, reflect and connect.\nOur community connections that are forged, often  last long after the retreat ends and sometimes life long friendships.",

If the person doesn’t have someone who can help them they have the right to have an independent Care Act advocate.</p><h3><br>Who can be supported by a Care Act advocate?</h3><p>Care Act advocates can support:</p><ul><li>Adults who need care and support</li><li>Carers</li><li>Children who are moving to adult care services</li></ul><p>If the council is making decisions about your care and support they must consider whether you would have ‘substantial difficulty’ being involved. Substantial difficulty would be if you have problems with one or more of these:</p><ul><li>Understanding information about the decisions</li><li>Remembering information</li><li>Using the information to be involved in the decisions</li><li>Being able to tell people your views, wishes and feelings</li></ul><p>The council then needs to consider whether you have an ‘appropriate individual’ to support you. This is someone who the council agree will be available and able to support you. It can be someone in your family or a friend but won’t be someone you don’t want to support you. It can’t be someone who is paid to look after you.</p><p>If the council decide that you would have substantial difficulty being involved and do not have an appropriate individual to support you, then you have the right to a Care Act advocate.</p><h3><br>How can a Care Act advocate help me?</h3><p>An advocate will support you to be involved as much as possible in decisions about your care. Your advocates can help you when the council is:</p><ul><li>Making a needs assessment</li><li>Making a carer’s assessment</li><li>Making or reviewing a care and support plan</li><li>Having a safeguarding enquiry (to check if you might be being abused) or arranging for a Safeguarding Adults Review</li></ul><p>Your advocate will work with you to help you understand what is happening and to give your views; they can speak for you if you can’t. Your advocate can help you to think about your choices and what is best for you. If you want to challenge the council’s decision your advocate can help you do this too.</p><p><br></p><h3>How do I get support from a Care Act advocate?</h3><p>Referrals are made through the local council.&nbsp;Please contact us if you need more information.</p><p><br></p>",

      "description": "Imagine a collective of unpaid carers of people with dementia with the advocacy skills, knowledge and passion for making positive change for everyone impacted by dementia. Thanks to the work of tide, you don’t have to imagine. Tide works side by side with carers to ensure that their voices are heard. The foundations of tide were born out of the daily struggle that a group of women experienced in looking after family members with dementia. They decided that they did not want their experiences to become a reality for future carers. Out of this powerful commitment, tide the charity was born.  \n\nHere at tide, we walk alongside carers. Every step of the way.  All that we do is grounded in the experience of the thousands of carers we have worked with over the years. We are continually inspired by the courageous people who come forward to add their voice to a growing movement. We see their confidence grow and lives change as carers realise the powerful impact of their voices. This is what motivates us. This is what keeps us moving forward.  \n\nWhether you are a current or former carer of someone with dementia, or a professional working with carers, tide is here for you. Join us and let's make the world a better place for everyone living with dementia in the UK.",

In doing this we also want to promote the care and maintenance of our environment.&nbsp;Everyone and anyone is welcome to attend. There is no charge for the walk. We always start&nbsp;at a local venue and aim to finish with drinks and biscuits. The walks are generally between three and five miles long. Well behaved dogs on leads are welcome.</p><p>We email all those interested two weeks prior to the walk. Please add your name to this list by emailing the secretary at the address above.</p><p>Haxey Parish is criss-crossed by over 40 miles of footpaths and bridleways. Walkers are faced with gentle slopes and flat fields interspersed with small woodlands ( including 2 SSSI sites ). With the River Idle walk on the southern boundary, a delightful wooded walk along a disused railway line, a maze of ancient rights of way and 3 long distance footpaths through the area there is plenty of variety.</p>",

While there are several different therapies and techniques available, the aims are the same:</p><p>To give you a safe place to talk to a trained professional without judgement.<br>To help you make sense of difficult feelings/emotions and understand yourself.<br>To help you resolve complicated issues or find ways to manage them.<br>To help you recognise unhelpful patterns and/or behaviours and find ways to change them (if you want to).</p><p>There are many benefits to counselling. While it was previously seen as a final option for those who have reached crisis point, now it is recognised as a preventative measure, a form of self-care in managing difficult feelings before they get worse.<br>As said, therapy can help you manage and cope with a number of things, including relationship problems, bereavement, anger, stress, depression and anxiety.</p><p>This list is not exhaustive. Counselling can help with long-term physical health problems, difficult life events such as losing your job and divorce, trauma and many other mental health concerns. Sometimes, simply speaking to a professional, and not your loved ones, can make all the difference. Friends don’t always understand, whereas a therapist can offer understanding and direction, while you speak in a safe, confidential space.</p>",

Nature can make us feel and think better and we also benefit from the movement as we take a gentle walk and connect with other living things around us. I offer an initial free call for us to&nbsp;connect and explore how we might work together. If you would like to speak please get in touch.</p>",

      "description": "Messingham has a long history and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It has always been a relatively large community but following World War II there was considerable housing development and the village has trebled in size to its present population of 4,000 inhabitants. Up to the beginning of the 20th Century agriculture was the main occupation but with the introduction of steelmaking to North Lincolnshire and the development of less labour intensive farming methods, land workers drifted into more industrial pursuits in nearby Scunthorpe.\n\nThe present day village boasts a public library, a medical centre, pharmacy, four public houses, a wine bar, two restaurants, tea room, café, four takeaway outlets, three small supermarkets (one incorporating the Post Office) and a number of smaller shops, including hairdressers, beautician, bakery, florist and a carpet shop. There are two places of worship – the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Methodist Church.\n\nMessingham is a lively village with a variety of thriving organisations, many of which use the spacious Village Hall as their venue. Leisure is well catered for with a well-equipped playing field, which includes a young Children’s Play Area and a  Multi Use Games Area; and an additional 20 acre recreation area which hosts, among other activities, gymkhanas, the annual Messingham Horse & Foal Show, and Messingham Junior football.",

    "description": "<h2>Crystal Healing - Energy Healing for the Mind, Body and Soul</h2><p>Crystal healing is a holistic and natural therapy that taps into the energetic power of crystals and how they affect the body and mind.</p><p>Crystal healing is an energy-based system. This means it is based on the belief that we are all made up of different energies and that when this becomes stagnant, unbalanced, or blocked, it can cause illness or dis - ease. The premise is that crystals help unblock, balance, and direct energy where it is most needed, gently supporting the body to heal in a therapeutic way.</p><p>Different types of crystals are thought to have different properties and energies. Just holding and being near these crystals is, therefore, thought to affect our own energies on a physical, spiritual, and emotional level.</p><p>Crystal healers have extensive knowledge of the different stones and how they affect us and are able to use them in healing sessions.</p><p>Crystal healing can be used for a huge range of different issues - physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual as well as attracting more of what you want including love, health, wealth and happiness.</p><p><br>It's important to note however,&nbsp; that crystal healing should not be seen as a substitute for medical or psychological treatment but rather as a complementary practice that can be used alongside conventional therapies.</p><p>To book a session please contact Deborah on&nbsp;07842 978437.</p>",

The best way to great health is to look after the whole body, not just the physical aspects but also the mental issues as well; as the saying goes \"Healthy Body, Healthy Mind\".\n\n\nLooking after your health as a whole package is so important, yet it is something that far too many people sadly neglect.  Our range of services has been put together in such a way that many of them complement each other.\n\n\nOur fully equipped personal training studio allows clients to work out in comfort and privacy. In addition this allows clients to also benefit from the expert advice of our personal trainers either with one-to-one support based on their individual goals or small group classes such as yoga.\n\n\nOur New Beginnings founder is also qualified in nutrition and is available to put together the best possible programme to assist with weight loss, fitness issues and helping to create a health body. For those clients who have issues with food, we can assist with this. Helping you to create a more positive and healthier person both on the outside and as well as on the inside can give you the real boost of confidence that can be invaluable in both a professional and personal capacity. \n\nFrom counselling to life coaching, our highly professional team can help you to overcome whatever it is that is preventing you from achieving your goals.",

One of these being non-epileptic seizures.\n\nWhen we hold onto these emotions, (whether aware of the fact or not) they can lead to many mental issues such as anxiety, panic attacks, fears, nightmares, relationship problems, or blockages in life.\n\nOnce released through a simple technique you will feel lighter and more yourself!",

    "name": "Fatigue & Breathlessness",
    "description": "<p>This service is for people who are diagnosed with cancer or a progressive life limiting disease such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), heart failure or multiple sclerosis,that affects their energy levels and breathing. Being fatigued, and particularly breathless, can be a very worrying or frightening experience, both for you and for the people around you at the time. It may affect how well you are able to do things such as climbing stairs, bathing, walking or going out. The aim of the FAB service is to help you and your family or carer cope with your symptoms.</p><p>You can self-refer into the FAB service or a healthcare professional such as your GP or complex care matron can complete a referral for you. Your first contact with our service will be via a member of the administrator team. The administrator will arrange for you to attend for a face-to-face assessment or if you would prefer, a telephone assessment with the clinical specialist physiotherapist or advanced care practitioner occupational therapist. Following your initial assessment, you will be offered further intervention via this service on a one to one basis or you will be allocated a place on our Breathe Easy Enablement Programme (BEEP). During your initial assessment, the physiotherapist or occupational therapist will explore your symptoms and how they affect your life. They will also look at how you breathe and explore what happens when you feel fatigued/breathless and what activities make you fatigued/breathless. You will be given the opportunity to ask questions and to gain a greater understanding about how best to manage your condition. You will be encouraged to set goals to help you manage functional and social activities and you will begin to learn about different strategies to help you manage your fatigue and breathlessness.</p><p>The one to one sessions are designed to provide specific focus for you depending on your most prominent symptom and you will begin working with the most appropriate healthcare professional to meet your needs. In the first instance, if fatigue is your main difficulty, you will likely be allocated for input with our occupational therapist - if breathlessness is your main difficulty, you will likely be allocated for input with our physiotherapist. Areas that we will cover during one to one sessions include: Coping with fatigue We will explore techniques to help you cope with your fatigue. We will, if appropriate, advise you about the following: • Keeping a fatigue/activity diary • Ergonomic assessments • Pacing, planning and prioritisation of activities • Cognition • Mood • Sleep hygiene • Relaxation and mindfulness techniques • Advice on managing meaningful occupations such as washing, dressing, working and gardening • Goal setting • Vocational rehabilitation (staying in and/or returning to work) Managing Breathlessness • Breathing control techniques • Positions to help alleviate breathlessness • Fan therapy • How to conserve energy during everyday activities • How to pace activities (such as stairs) • How to manage anxiety/panic attacks • Relaxation techniques • Chest clearance techniques (if required) • Exercises We will also endeavour to help alleviate your fears in relation to your breathlessness. Attending the clinic will also enable us and assist you to recognise symptoms that require medical intervention so that you can receive treatment sooner rather than later.</p><p>The group programme runs for a period of 8 weeks and the content is designed to support both you and your main carer, be that a relative or friend. The group delivers a programme of education and support alongside advice and practice of exercises and movement that aim to enhance your quality of life. The education sessions are designed for both you and your carer. You will then participate in our tailored exercise programme, whilst your carer has the opportunity to access an advice and support session with our registered counsellor. The BEEP programme includes advice and support which covers: • Breathlessness management • Energy conservation and fatigue • Planning for the future • Anxiety and low mood • Managing your disease and recognising red flags • Sleep hygiene • Relaxation and mindfulness Depending on whether you attend for one to one intervention or intervention as group, you will be expected to put into practice what you have learned and progress will be reviewed during follow up conversations. Emotional and other support We appreciate that fatigue and breathlessness can be a frustrating and difficult symptom to live with and that it can affect you psychologically as well as physically. Your care team aims to support you through your treatment when you are referred into the fatigue and breathlessness service however other services such as complementary therapy and counselling may be recommended to offer support in conjunction with your fatigue and breathlessness management plans to help implement strategies in the longer term. These services can be accessed via your care team if required. How will I get there? The service requires you to make your own way to your appointments. If you have transport problems, the voluntary car service may be able to help (mileage rates apply) or alternatively, a remote assessment/support can be provided. How long is my treatment likely to last? One to one sessions vary from 1 – 1 ½ hours depending on your needs. When attending the group programme (BEEP), the session will last approximately 2 hours however will be a mixture of education and exercise. Once you have completed your sessions, you will be discharged back to the care of your GP. However should you require support in the future, you will be able to contact the FAB service directly for any help or support after this time if required. Sources of further information Cancellations Due to the large number of patients requiring treatment and the limited availability of clinic appointments we are required to have a strict cancellation policy.</p><p>If you cancel or do not attend three appointments or more, we may discharge you from the service and notification of this will be sent to your GP. Any further treatment will require a new referral from an appropriate healthcare practitioner. In the event of extenuating circumstances this may be reviewed. Please give as much notice as possible when cancelling appointments so that your appointment slot can be offered to someone else</p>",

    "description": "<p>First Steps Forward (FSF) is an exciting new project being delivered in partnership with Community Vision, Westcliffe Community Works, and Crosby Community Association, which is being built around strengthening our deprived communities, with particular emphasis on the experiences of young children up to the age of five, and their wider families. The aim of the project is to help tackle the broad inequalities that some families face, which significantly impact on the future life chances of children and perpetuate an intergenerational cycle of deprivation.<br></p><p>Currently the service is only operational within Scunthorpe communities, because this is where the highest level of inequalities sits. As a community-based approach, it is important that we strengthen the support by working with other community-based services and that is why we are working in partnership with VANL, NL MIND, Westcliffe Community Works, and Crosby Community Association, who are operating in the heart of community and therefore best placed to engage and enable wider community groups and organisations to welcome and support families to benefit. The benefits of this approach for families will be increased confidence, skills, and aspirations, creating a culture of acceptance and inclusion.</p><p>The support will address the risks and barriers faced by families and deliver a bespoke service aimed at meeting the whole needs of the family in achieving a positive, successful, and healthy life by offering the following:</p><p>​Parenting Support</p><ul><li><p>Coaching, mentoring, and working towards personal goals and aspirations.</p></li><li><p>Supporting to improve relationships with family, friends, and community.</p></li><li><p>Navigation and support to understand and improve relationships with other agencies, i.e. schools, health, and social workers etc</p></li><li><p>Practical help to ensure the safety of adults and children.</p></li><li><p>Mental Health, counselling and wellbeing support offered by NL MIND.</p></li></ul><p>The service is now ‘live’ and offering bespoke support to families, which will be tailored to the needs identified by parents themselves and designed to specifically address their needs, goals, and aspirations. It will happen in the place the family feels most comfortable in, including their own home. Families will be offered 1 to 1 support provided by family Support Coordinators staff and volunteers.</p><p>​Referral&nbsp;for Support&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a parent of a child under five&nbsp;living in Scunthorpe and feel like you need support to deal with issues affecting the wellbeing of your family, please contact us to hear how we can help.

Since the gallery’s doors first opened in 2001 we have developed a reputation for offering a varied and exciting exhibition programme of contemporary art, craft and design.  We show around 20 exhibitions per year, across six exhibition spaces, and aim to be as ambitious and creatively diverse.  As well as bringing arts and culture to the local community, we aim to exhibit art by groups that are traditionally under represented in mainstream galleries.\n\nEncompassing a wide range of media, subjects and artistic approaches, we present a mixture of in-house curated exhibitions, touring shows and exhibitions developed in partnership with fellow creative organisations.  We also produce and deliver our own touring exhibitions to other galleries nationally, and offer an extensive education programme for all ages and abilities.\n\nWe’re an Arts Council England [National Portfolio Organisation (NPO] which means funding thanks to tax payers and National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.",

As well as seeking the public’s views ourselves, we also encourage services to involve people in decisions that affect them. Our sole purpose is to help make care better for people.&nbsp;</p><h2>In summary Healthwatch is here to:</h2><ul><li>Help people find out about local care.&nbsp;</li><li>Listen to what people think of services.&nbsp;</li><li>Help improve the quality of services by letting those running services and the government know what people want from care.&nbsp;</li><li>Encourage people running services to involve people in changes to care.</li></ul><p>Healthwatch was established in 2013 and each local authority area has its own Healthwatch service. For details of Healthwatch services in other areas,&nbsp;<strong><a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/your-local-healthwatch/list\" href=\"https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/your-local-healthwatch/list\">click here</a></strong>.</p><h2>What are the aims of Healthwatch?</h2><p><strong>Our vision</strong></p><p>Equitable Health and Care services that meet the needs of every person within our community.</p><p><strong>Our mission</strong></p><p>To give every person the opportunity to have their voices heard and empower them to play an active role in shaping services in their community.</p><p><strong>Our values</strong></p><ul><li>We are proud to be independent, and not afraid to speak up and challenge decisions that do not meet the needs of our communities.</li><li>We operate a culture of transparency and openness, ensuring we are accountable to the communities in which we serve.</li><li>Our work is evidence based – led by public voice and need.&nbsp;</li><li>We are collaborative, working with organisations that share our vision of equitable health and care services that meet the needs of every person within our communities.</li></ul><h2>How do we work?</h2><p>Healthwatch is for everyone in our community – adults, young people and children. Every voice counts when it comes to shaping the future of services and improving them for today. Healthwatch will help people get the best out of their local health and social care services.</p><p>People often don’t speak up because they don’t think they can make a difference. We know that people can be unaware of the care and support that is out there. People can feel excluded from services and access to services and treatment isn’t always equal. Those who are least able to speak out will be heard through Healthwatch.</p><p>Every voice counts when it comes to shaping the future of health and social care, and when it comes to improving it for today. Everything that Healthwatch does will bring the voice and influence of local people to the development and delivery of local services.</p><p>Through our network of volunteers, working with existing voluntary and community groups, and our independent research, we can find out what matters to you most about health and social care. Together, your views and our expertise will help shape improvements for everyone.</p><p>We will use the information we gather to spot important local issues and trends. And we will carry out our own research into those issues that need more investigating, working closely with existing voluntary and community groups and the authorities.</p><p>Most importantly, we have powers in law which gives us influence. We will feedback what we discover to the authorities who have a legal responsibility to respond and use our findings to shape and improve services and feedback to you on the outcomes. This means you can be reassured that your views really do count.</p><h2>How are we set up?</h2><p>Each local Healthwatch is commissioned and funded by the Local Authority.

We are not all supposed to look and be the same.</li><li>Your friends should make you feel better and happy about yourself ALL the time. There is no such thing as a bad friend.</li><li>No one has the right to harm you physically, mentally or emotionally. You are amazing.</li><li>It is OK to say NO to anything and anyone that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe.</li></ul><p>Social media is a fun place but also has a dark side so tread carefully. As a general rule do not say or do anything online you would not be happy doing face to face.</p><p>So long as you do your best, the world will respond and you will succeed.</p><p>Never feel pressured into doing things you do not want to do before you feel ready and be informed about safety and consent.</p><p>Be savvy about the media messages coming at you from every angle every day. Know that reality TV is fake and most of the images in magazines and online are airbrushed and with many celebs and models addicted to cosmetic surgery which is NOT necessary.</p><p>Know your value as a person is not measured by how much you weigh or what you look like. You are already enough and it is important to be YOU.</p><p>Always think big, reach for the stars and never let anyone disrespect you or belittle your dreams.</p><p>The after-school programme caters for up to 20 girls at a time in the same year and is suitable for girls in Years 7 to Years 11 and is hosted on New Beginnings premises on East Common Lane.</p><p>Mondays at 4.15pm and Wednesdays at 3.45pm, FULLY FUNDED.</p><p>Our mission at New Beginnings Personal Training and Wellness Facility is to build every single female’s confidence on the inside and out.

    "description": "<h3>What is an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)?</h3><p>An IMCA is an advocate who has been specially trained to support people who are not able to make certain decisions for themselves and do not have family or friends who are able to speak for them. IMCAs do not make decisions and they are independent of the people who do make the decisions.</p><p>An IMCA can support anyone who is over 16 years old and who has been assessed as ‘lacking capacity’. This means they are not able to make or understand a particular decision about their life because the way their mind or brain works has been affected by an illness, an injury or a disability. They must have been assessed by a doctor or a social worker at the time the particular decision needs to be made. The person might have dementia, learning disabilities, mental health problems, a brain injury or they might have had a stroke. A lack of capacity can be temporary such as when someone has been in an accident and is unconscious.</p><h3><br>When can an IMCA be instructed?</h3><p>An IMCA can be instructed (asked to represent a person) when a decision needs to be made about:</p><ul><li>Serious medical treatment - when the NHS wants to give new treatment, stop treatment that is already being given or when they do not want to start treatment or</li><li>A&nbsp;change of accommodation - when the NHS or local council wants to move a person to hospital for more than 28 days or to other accommodation for more than eight&nbsp;weeks.</li></ul><p>It&nbsp;should also be considered whether it would be helpful for an IMCA to be instructed for two other issues:</p><ul><li>Safeguarding adults from abuse<em>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</em>when the NHS or local council receives a report of abuse and either the person reported to have been abused or reported to be the abuser lacks capacity to understand the plans being made to prevent the abuse. This is the only type of issue where the person can have family or friends to support them and still have IMCA support.&nbsp;</li><li>Care reviews<em>&nbsp;–&nbsp;</em>when the NHS or local council has arranged accommodation or wants to review arrangements for a person who lacks capacity.</li></ul><p>Different&nbsp;councils have different arrangements for these issues so please contact us if you need more information.</p><h3><br>What is the role of an IMCA?</h3><p>POhWER’s IMCAs find out as much as possible about the views and beliefs of the person referred to them. They have the right to meet the person privately and to see their health and care records. An IMCA considers all relevant information about the person then writes a report to help decision-makers reach decisions which are in the best interests of the person. Sometimes they might look at options which were not suggested by the professional or ask for a second medical opinion. An IMCA has the right to challenge any decision made.</p><h3><br>What is the Court of Protection?</h3><p>The Court of Protection is a special court which looks at cases about people who lack capacity to make decisions. If a very serious decision needs to be made it might be sent to the Court of Protection. The court makes decisions and appoints people called deputies who can act for someone who is not able to make decisions about their personal health, finance or welfare.</p><p><br></p><h3>How do I get support from an IMCA?</h3><p>Referrals are made by the local council or the NHS. Please contact us if you need more information.</p><p><br></p><h3>What are the Mental Capacity Act Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards?</h3><p>Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) protect people who lack capacity to consent to being deprived of their liberty. This means that because an illness, an injury or a disability has affected the way their mind works they are not able to agree that they will not be allowed to do certain things.</p><p>Because of the DoLS vulnerable people cannot have their freedom taken away unless it is in their best interests and there is no ‘less restrictive alternative’ (an option which will affect the person’s freedom or rights less).</p><p>The Supervisory Body (the local council where the person normally lives) decides if a person can legally be deprived of their liberty and for how long. To do this they arrange assessments.</p><h3><br>What is a Deprivation of Liberty?</h3><p>When a Managing Authority (either a care home or hospital) has a reasonable belief they may be depriving a&nbsp;person in their care of their liberty, they make an application to the Supervisory Body at the Local Authority responsible for the person’s care for a Standard Authorisation; they may also grant themselves an Urgent Authorisation which allows the Managing Authority to legally deprive the person of their liberty for seven&nbsp;days whilst assessments take place.&nbsp; The Supervisory Body will then put a process in place to review this placement to establish:</p><ul><li>If a Deprivation of Liberty (DoL) is taking place and whether what’s called the ‘Acid Test’ from Cheshire West Supreme Court ruling is met</li><li><p>The ‘Acid Test’ is whether the person is being continually monitored and supervised where they are,&nbsp;living and get no unsupervised access to the community, and whether the person would&nbsp;be free to leave and live where they wanted. If the person is always escorted, whether by staff or family/friends, and they would be stopped from moving to another place, then the Acid Test is met and the person is being deprived of their liberty.</p></li><li>If the deprivation is in the best interests of the person</li><li>If any conditions need to be met to ensure the DoL continues to be in the person’s best interests, and that any restrictions placed upon the person are as few or as restrictive as necessary</li><li>Restrictions can include not accessing the community, being able to exercise their faith, use of medication or equipment, not pursuing hobbies and pastimes the person would enjoy</li><li>Who will visit and monitor the person’s placement for the duration of the DoL</li></ul><p>If the Supervisory Body then concludes the evidence is met that the person must be deprived of their liberty, the Supervisory Body will authorise the DoL for up to a year. Each authorisation has to be reviewed towards the end date.</p><h3><br>Who does the Mental Capacity Act Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards apply to?</h3><p>DoLS apply to anyone who is 18 or over and who lacks capacity to consent to being deprived of their liberty. The safeguards cover patients in hospitals and people in care homes but do not apply to patients who are detained under the Mental Health Act.</p><h3><br>How do POhWER advocates support people?</h3><p>Our advocates protect the human rights of people who lack capacity and seem to be being deprived of their liberty. Our advocates work with them to make sure the deprivation is lawful, reasonable and in their best interests.</p><p>When the Supervisory Body is considering a DoLS authorisation an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) should be appointed for anyone who does not have a suitable friend or family member to speak for them. The IMCA supports the person and collects information about them including their beliefs, values and previous behaviour and uses this to write a report for the assessors. The IMCA can also challenge decisions made by the assessors. This is a 39A IMCA.</p><p>When the Supervisory Body authorises (agrees) a deprivation of liberty it must make sure the person deprived of their liberty has a representative who can explain their rights to them and how they can use them. If a family member or friend is willing and able to take this on they become the person’s unpaid representative. If there is no unpaid representative a&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.pohwer.net/relevant-persons-paid-representative-service-rppr\" href=\"https://www.pohwer.net/relevant-persons-paid-representative-service-rppr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paid Representative</a>&nbsp;is appointed.&nbsp;</p><p>If there is a gap between representatives an IMCA can be appointed temporarily; this is a 39C IMCA.</p><p>An IMCA can also be appointed when a person who has an unpaid representative if:</p><ul><li>The person asks for support; or</li><li>The unpaid representative asks for support; or</li><li>The Supervisory Body thinks either the person or the unpaid representative would benefit from support.</li></ul><p>This is a 39D IMCA.<br></p><h3>How do I get support from an advocate?</h3><p>Referrals are made through the local council.&nbsp;Please contact us if you need more information.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Jack Warnock is a multi-instrumentalist and singer from Maghera, Co. Derry. Throughout his career, Jack has performed as a soloist, accompanist, and in groups such as TRODA, Cóiriú and The Doc Flock. He has performed at events, festivals, and venues across the world. In recent years Jack has been nominated for the prestigious BBC Young Folk Award, won the Senior Accompaniment Competition at Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann, and received the Young Musician’s Platform award from ACNI and BBC NI.</p><p>Absorbing music from an early age and playing the piano from the age of seven, Jack’s love of trad would really blossom when he picked up the guitar in his teens. He quickly fell in love with the tunes and songs that seemed to surround him, and that was that – his calling was clear. His guitar style has been guided and influenced by many greats, including John Doyle, Tim Edey, Ed Boyd, Tony McManus and Seamie O’Dowd, to name but a few.</p><p>An avid Gaeilgeoir, Jack performs songs in both Irish and English. His compositions and selections are steeped in storytelling, as he embraces the lineage of folk music in its truest form. Nine years have passed since his debut EP, so it’s fair to say his debut album Le Solas Faoithine has been a long-time coming. The name Le Solas Faoithine (translating as By Dusklight) was the product of new routines brought on by lockdowns.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the album is a masterwork of thought, consideration, and beautiful curation. Recorded and produced by himself and Dónal O’Connor, Le Solas Faoithine features contributions from Toby Shaer, Archie Churchill-Moss, and Conor Mallon, and can comfortably sit alongside any traditional Irish debut release of recent times. A masterclass.</p><p>Please see the website for booking information and pricing.</p>",

Otway had just had some success with his autobiography – Rock and Roll’s greatest Failure. The plan at the time was to rid their microstar of this title and to endow him with a degree of success.</p><p>Over the subsequent years, in many ways, you could argue that this could be a project that had been achieved. The Otway Band went on to headline the Royal Albert Hall in 1998, appear on Top of the Pops with a Top Ten Hit Bunsen Burner in 2012 and become the first band since the Rolling Stones to record an album on the Caribbean island of Montserrat.</p><p>However, his movie, Rock and Roll’s Greatest Failure (voted the nation’s Second Favourite Movie of 2014 by Guardian readers and currently getting a large audience on Netflix), means that currently the label is firmly attached to his profile. In a brave attempt to move on, the Otway Band are embarking on a lengthy UK tour, The Set Remains the Same, with the material that has brought them those remarkable achievements over the past three decades.</p><p>The chances of this working are not looking good, however. Otway has already made comments like:&nbsp;<em>“Well, maybe we could put a couple of different songs into the show for a change.”</em></p><p><strong>The Otway Band</strong><br>John Otway – Vocals, Guitar, Theremin<br>Richard Holgarth – Guitar<br>Murray Torkildsen – Guitar<br>Seymour – Bass<br>Adam Batterbee – Drums</p>",

Although several of the instructors share the Smith surname it is only coincidence.\n\nMost of our instructors joined Twin Tigers to follow their own path many years ago and have since decided to share the life skills and benefits they found with others.\n\nTwin Tigers is dedicated to developing our students, through a martial arts education.\n\nOur instruction team work tirelessly to get the best out of each student. We ensure that our student’s progression is earned, never given. No matter the skill level or ability, we tailor our student’s experiences to secure the best Martial Arts education possible, for children, adults and everyone in between, we have a class for you.\n\nWe believe not only do we have the best instruction team in the area, we also have the best facilities by far",

Timid students transform into warriors, students becoming trainers and a whole lot of changes at our venue. But no matter who’s training or what we’ve had to train with, our goal has remained the same – to provide our community of Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire with the finest Martial Arts education we can offer.\n\nWe are blessed to have an incredible team of dedicated instructors including Master grades in both our key martial arts.\n\nAt the core of the team Master Smith and wife Lisa Smith work to maintain the family values of the school. Although several of the instructors share the Smith surname it is only coincidence.\n\nMost of our instructors joined Twin Tigers to follow their own path many years ago and have since decided to share the life skills and benefits they found with others.\n\nTwin Tigers is dedicated to developing our students, through a martial arts education.\n\nOur instruction team work tirelessly to get the best out of each student. We ensure that our student’s progression is earned, never given. No matter the skill level or ability, we tailor our student’s experiences to secure the best Martial Arts education possible, for children, adults and everyone in between, we have a class for you.\n\nWe believe not only do we have the best instruction team in the area, we also have the best facilities by far",

Since the gallery’s doors first opened in 2001 we have developed a reputation for offering a varied and exciting exhibition programme of contemporary art, craft and design.  We show around 20 exhibitions per year, across six exhibition spaces, and aim to be as ambitious and creatively diverse.  As well as bringing arts and culture to the local community, we aim to exhibit art by groups that are traditionally under represented in mainstream galleries.\n\nEncompassing a wide range of media, subjects and artistic approaches, we present a mixture of in-house curated exhibitions, touring shows and exhibitions developed in partnership with fellow creative organisations.  We also produce and deliver our own touring exhibitions to other galleries nationally, and offer an extensive education programme for all ages and abilities.\n\nWe’re an Arts Council England [National Portfolio Organisation (NPO] which means funding thanks to tax payers and National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.",

From then, this little \"kickabout\" has grown into a group of over 45s getting together weekly for a good old game of footy.&nbsp;</p><p>It's not a formal football club and nor do we want it to be.&nbsp;</p><p>As one member said, \"It's been a fantastic opportunity for him to get to know people in the town, have a good old kickabout and have a laugh whilst doing it.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Our youngest member is 45 and our oldest, currently 67.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to be fit, good at football or even available every week. You just need to want to&nbsp;\"have a go\" and be respectful of everyone's ages and abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The \"lads\" meet every Tuesday (6 for 6.30pm) and play lasts an hour. We try and do two charity matches per year. We ask for a £2 contribution each week and at the end of the year, all money raised will go to a local Kirton charity of our choice.</p><p>Contact must be made via the website in the first instance, if you want to come along and play.</p>",

Quite a number of our members hail from&nbsp;neighbouring towns and villages including Barrow, Barton, Barnetby, Ulceby, East Halton,&nbsp;Kirmington and one player has stayed with us even after moving north of the Humber.</p><p>We are keen to introduce newcomers, of all ages, to the pleasures (and occasional frustrations) of lawn bowling. For family bowlers it is one of the few sports where one can lose to your children, your parents and possibly your grandparents all on the same day!</p><p>Whether you are looking for just a fun social activity or are keen to compete in a new sport, bowling has a lot to offer even those who do not consider themselves especially 'sporty' or who have health issues that may make other sports too difficult.</p><p>Currently&nbsp;Goxhill Bowling&nbsp;Club competes&nbsp;in four leagues:<br>Grimsby, Cleethorpes &amp; District Bowls Association - Premier Division of the Rinks League<br>Scunthorpe &amp; District Bowls League - First Division<br>Barnetby &amp; District Bowling League<br>North Lincolnshire Bowls Triples Leagues - Second Division of the Mixed League<br>These entail playing against clubs the length and breadth of both North and North-East Lincolnshire as well as&nbsp;across to north of the Humber when cup draws dictate. Full membership of the Club entitles you to play for us in any of the leagues or cup competitions.</p><p>Come along and give bowling a try - all you'll need will be some reasonably flat shoes so as not to spoil the bowling green. We will provide you with everything else necessary, including coaching from experienced bowlers. You'll be surprised how rapidly you will pick it up - but beware, it can become quite addictive.</p><p>Contact :&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href=\"https://goxhill-bowls-club.weebly.com/\" href=\"https://goxhill-bowls-club.weebly.com/\">Goxhill Bowling Club charity no. 1195169 - Home (weebly.com)</a></p><p>The outdoor bowling season runs from about mid-April until mid September with the exact starting and ending dates partly determined by the weather.&nbsp;</p><p>We have regular weekly \"roll-up\" sessions on a Tuesday afternoon during the season, where no membership is needed.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in bowling more often than once a week but don't want to play in league games then we offer a 'social' membership to entitle you to use the green whenever it is available. Please contact us if you would like further details about any of those options - you won't regret it.</p>",

      "description": "Messingham has a long history and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It has always been a relatively large community but following World War II there was considerable housing development and the village has trebled in size to its present population of 4,000 inhabitants. Up to the beginning of the 20th Century agriculture was the main occupation but with the introduction of steelmaking to North Lincolnshire and the development of less labour intensive farming methods, land workers drifted into more industrial pursuits in nearby Scunthorpe.\n\nThe present day village boasts a public library, a medical centre, pharmacy, four public houses, a wine bar, two restaurants, tea room, café, four takeaway outlets, three small supermarkets (one incorporating the Post Office) and a number of smaller shops, including hairdressers, beautician, bakery, florist and a carpet shop. There are two places of worship – the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Methodist Church.\n\nMessingham is a lively village with a variety of thriving organisations, many of which use the spacious Village Hall as their venue. Leisure is well catered for with a well-equipped playing field, which includes a young Children’s Play Area and a  Multi Use Games Area; and an additional 20 acre recreation area which hosts, among other activities, gymkhanas, the annual Messingham Horse & Foal Show, and Messingham Junior football.",

Frank Sinatra had too few to mention, but Lucy’s got hundreds, and she’s prepared to go into graphic detail about all of them. Disastrous dates, professional calamities, ruined friendships and parenting fails. Lucy describes all the mistakes she’s made, works out why they happened, and ponders how her life would have turned out if she’d acted differently.&nbsp;</p><p>Lucy looks at the things we might all collectively regret – not sticking to the work-life balance we strove for during lockdown, not realising that clapping for the NHS wouldn’t be enough to save it, allowing people we thought were quite fun on TV to become politicians.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;How does regret tie in with guilt and shame? As a middle-aged, middle-class, left-leaning ex-Catholic, guilt is one of Lucy’s top five hobbies (along with going to the garden centre, doing jigsaws, making bread and watching subtitled foreign dramas on Netflix. She’s also ashamed of all these hobbies.)</p><p>It’s not all negative though. If you regret something, you can use it to change your ways: see the thing you regret as your rock bottom, and let it spur you on to become a better person. Lucy looks at how she can use shameful or annoying things from her past to change her future.</p><p>Lucy regrets volunteering at the school fete when her kids were younger, because now she’s committed to being the Hook a Duck Lady twice a year for the rest of her life. Maybe she could learn to say No a bit more?&nbsp;</p><p>£20/£22 OTD</p><p>Book tickets via the Ropery Hall website</p>",

    "name": "Lymphoedema",
    "description": "<p>What is Lymphoedema? Lymphoedema is a chronic condition which causes swelling to any part of the body but is most common in the arms and legs. This condition develops when the lymphatic system, which drains fluid from the tissues of the body, does not function normally due to either a congenital abnormality or under development (Primary Lymphoedema), deficiency or damage to the lymphatic system (Secondary Lymphoedema) which can be due to cancer, surgery, radiotherapy, trauma, disease, infection, obesity etc. Lymphoedema cannot be cured but it can be treated and well managed, particularly if diagnosed early.</p><p>What to expect from our service Our Lymphoedema Team consists of nurse therapists, physiotherapists, lymphoedema therapists and administrative support. Your first contact with our service will be a call from one of our team to book an assessment visit. During this appointment we will ask questions about your health and your lymphoedema and how it may be affecting you at this time. We will also examine and measure the affected area and check your weight. This will give you the opportunity to ask questions and to gain a greater understanding about the management of the condition and how we can work together to achieve a good result. By attending for treatment and following your therapist’s advice, our aim is to start to control your lymphoedema rather than it controlling you.</p><p>Manual Lymphatic Drainage and Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a specialised therapy designed to improve the function of the lymphatic system. This is achieved through gentle movements to the skin which help draw lymph fluid into the lymph vessels below the skin. MLD results in a greater amount of waste products and excess fluid being removed from the body’s tissues into the lymphatic system. This effect can also be achieved by use of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) where a pump is used to simulate MLD. Your therapist will assess which is the most appropriate for you. Simple Lymphatic Drainage You will be taught Simple Lymphatic Drainage (SLD) which is a simple form of MLD for you to use regularly at home to manage your lymphoedema.</p><p>Compression Garments/Bandaging - For many people the use of compression garments for the affected limb or area can contribute greatly to the long term management of lymphoedema. One of our team will carefully measure you for the appropriate garment. This should be comfortable however if you experience any pins and needles or pain, or your fingers or toes change colour, it is too tight. Remove it straight away and contact your lymphoedema therapist for advice. It is important that you are properly measured and fitted to prevent these problems from occurring. The use of compression bandages to improve the shape and size of a swollen limb may be appropriate for a limited number of patients for a short period of time. This will be discussed with you if the team feel that you will benefit. Compression, in whatever form, plays a vital role in the management of your lymphoedema and your compliance is vital.</p><p>Lymphoedema Taping -&nbsp; A special taping technique can be applied to gently lift the top layer of the skin allowing lymph fluid to drain more easily therefore helping to manage pain and swelling. It is often used in areas where it is difficult to apply compression therapy. Skin Care Skin health and skin care is really important, especially for the area affected by lymphoedema. We will advise you on how best to look after your skin and prevent infection, how to recognise an infection and what to do in the event of an infection.</p><p>Exercise - Exercise can promote natural drainage of lymph fluid. Advice will be given about what is beneficial and what is not advisable to do regarding exercise. Lifestyle Changes Where indicated you may be advised about diet, weight loss and going to bed at night if this is not your usual pattern. Emotional Support We appreciate that lymphoedema is a difficult condition to live with and will aim to support you through your treatment. Other support services are available at the hospice and can be accessed via your lymphoedema therapist if appropriate</p><p>How long is a treatment likely to last? Your assessment visit will take between one and a half to two hours. Any further appointments will take no more than one hour. The use of this time will vary according to the therapist’s assessment and your treatment needs. Treatment can continue over several weeks/months however the frequency of visits will be reduced once your lymphoedema is stable. If you are self-managing, you may be discharged back to the care of your GP, but you will be able to contact the service directly for any help or support after this time if required. Cancellations Due to the large number of patients requiring treatment and the limited availability of clinic appointments we are required to have a strict cancellation policy.</p><p>If you cancel more than three times in one year we may discharge you from the service and notification of this will be sent to your GP. Any further treatment will require a new referral from an appropriate healthcare practitioner. In the event of extenuating circumstances this may be reviewed. Please give as much notice as possible when cancelling appointments so that your appointment slot can be offered to someone else.</p>",

      "description": "Messingham has a long history and was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It has always been a relatively large community but following World War II there was considerable housing development and the village has trebled in size to its present population of 4,000 inhabitants. Up to the beginning of the 20th Century agriculture was the main occupation but with the introduction of steelmaking to North Lincolnshire and the development of less labour intensive farming methods, land workers drifted into more industrial pursuits in nearby Scunthorpe.\n\nThe present day village boasts a public library, a medical centre, pharmacy, four public houses, a wine bar, two restaurants, tea room, café, four takeaway outlets, three small supermarkets (one incorporating the Post Office) and a number of smaller shops, including hairdressers, beautician, bakery, florist and a carpet shop. There are two places of worship – the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Methodist Church.\n\nMessingham is a lively village with a variety of thriving organisations, many of which use the spacious Village Hall as their venue. Leisure is well catered for with a well-equipped playing field, which includes a young Children’s Play Area and a  Multi Use Games Area; and an additional 20 acre recreation area which hosts, among other activities, gymkhanas, the annual Messingham Horse & Foal Show, and Messingham Junior football.",

Out of a blossoming musical friendship, they began a collaborative project that takes the soul-stirring euphoria of Deepa’s sufi singing as a starting point, and weaves in the threads of Mishra’s UK folk and Indian classical influences to create a captivating cross-cultural sound. Their joyous performances are a journey of contrasts, from hand-clapping trance-like sufi songs to spacious stillness and reflection.<br><br>Mishra are a collective of musicians with a growing reputation for forging a distinctive path through music rooted in diverse traditions. Founded as a duo of Kate Griffin on banjo and vocals and Ford Collier (The Drystones) on low whistle and percussion, the pair recruited some of the finest musicians exploring the meeting points of world, folk, and jazz on the Sheffield music scene: John Ball (Rafiki Jazz) on tabla and santoor, Joss Mann-Hazell (Auka) on double bass, and Alex Lyon on clarinets and vocals. Since forming in 2018, Mishra have won Celtic Connections’ prestigious ‘Danny Kyle’ award, received BBC Radio 2 airplay for their albums ‘The Loft Tapes’ and ‘Reclaim’, and performed at festivals including Cambridge Folk Festival, Beardy, Timber, and more.<br><br>Over 30 years of studying Indian music and working across genres under the banner of ‘world music’, Deepa Shakthi has forged an international reputation as a vocalist and composer, receiving awards and acclaim in the UK and India. She has worked with artists including Ravi Shankar and toured with Opera North’s production of Orpheus.</p><p>For ticket details please visit the website.</p>",

I started fitness quite late on in life doing the initial training with my daughter as she didn’t want to do it on her own and from then on I was hooked and have never looked back.\n\nWell firstly my participants are my priority and I understand that to enjoy a class you need to feel welcome and safe; you need to know its ok if the class is moving in one direction and you’re going in the other its fine. Everybody does it so you’re not the first and won’t be the last.\n\nI think my classes have been popular for so many years is because they are fun, hey even I go wrong but we can laugh about it.\n\nIts important you work at a level that feels good for you and you are in an environment that allows this.\n\nI know there are barriers to fitness for many people but hopefully the classes can help remove some of those for you and leave you feeling empowered and crush any doubts you may had about yourself and abilities.",

After a few moves and a temporary closure during the Second World War, the community known as Scunthorpe Baptist Church found its home on Ashby Road.\n\nAlmost exactly a century after that first service the members of the church made the audacious and bold decision to close and reopen as ‘Connect Church’; a new venture built from the ground up to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century world.",

Since the gallery’s doors first opened in 2001 we have developed a reputation for offering a varied and exciting exhibition programme of contemporary art, craft and design.  We show around 20 exhibitions per year, across six exhibition spaces, and aim to be as ambitious and creatively diverse.  As well as bringing arts and culture to the local community, we aim to exhibit art by groups that are traditionally under represented in mainstream galleries.\n\nEncompassing a wide range of media, subjects and artistic approaches, we present a mixture of in-house curated exhibitions, touring shows and exhibitions developed in partnership with fellow creative organisations.  We also produce and deliver our own touring exhibitions to other galleries nationally, and offer an extensive education programme for all ages and abilities.\n\nWe’re an Arts Council England [National Portfolio Organisation (NPO] which means funding thanks to tax payers and National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.",

Thanks to the work of tide, you don’t have to imagine. Tide works side by side with carers to ensure that their voices are heard. The foundations of tide were born out of the daily struggle that a group of women experienced in looking after family members with dementia. They decided that they did not want their experiences to become a reality for future carers. Out of this powerful commitment, tide the charity was born.  \n\nHere at tide, we walk alongside carers. Every step of the way.  All that we do is grounded in the experience of the thousands of carers we have worked with over the years. We are continually inspired by the courageous people who come forward to add their voice to a growing movement. We see their confidence grow and lives change as carers realise the powerful impact of their voices. This is what motivates us. This is what keeps us moving forward.  \n\nWhether you are a current or former carer of someone with dementia, or a professional working with carers, tide is here for you. Join us and let's make the world a better place for everyone living with dementia in the UK.",

Timid students transform into warriors, students becoming trainers and a whole lot of changes at our venue. But no matter who’s training or what we’ve had to train with, our goal has remained the same – to provide our community of Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire with the finest Martial Arts education we can offer.\n\nWe are blessed to have an incredible team of dedicated instructors including Master grades in both our key martial arts.\n\nAt the core of the team Master Smith and wife Lisa Smith work to maintain the family values of the school. Although several of the instructors share the Smith surname it is only coincidence.\n\nMost of our instructors joined Twin Tigers to follow their own path many years ago and have since decided to share the life skills and benefits they found with others.\n\nTwin Tigers is dedicated to developing our students, through a martial arts education.\n\nOur instruction team work tirelessly to get the best out of each student. We ensure that our student’s progression is earned, never given. No matter the skill level or ability, we tailor our student’s experiences to secure the best Martial Arts education possible, for children, adults and everyone in between, we have a class for you.\n\nWe believe not only do we have the best instruction team in the area, we also have the best facilities by far",

It is not about telling women what to do but empowering them to make their own choices. Those who have experienced abuse have little or no understanding of what has happened to them and it simply feels like a painful and confusing mess for which they are largely to blame; the Freedom Programme aims to start turning this around at the women’s own pace. The philosophy of the programme is based on research and outlines the role played in such offending by the pursuit of power and control.

The Friday evening sessions last from 5.30pm until 6pm, and are action-packed with singing games and rhymes.&nbsp;The songs are carefully selected to help promote skills such as keeping a steady pulse, performing simple rhythm patterns, listening for tone quality, and accurately matching the pitch of other singers. These singing games and rhymes are also excellent for developing early literacy and numeracy skills, as well as promoting social skills and building confidence. Children attend along with their parents, who are also encouraged to join in with the session.&nbsp;</p>",

Bring along a sewing project that you either want some help with or that you just want to be able to work on without the interruptions of home. I will be on hand to help everyone with anything tricky. You will need your sewing kit, project components and sewing machine, there will be tables, irons and extension leads provided. There is also the usual haberdashery ‘shop’ for needles, pins etc in case you run out of bits and bobs.</p><p>This is a full day session so it will advisable to bring a pack up, although there will be a piece of cake for everyone, along with hot drinks, water and biscuits to help yourself to all day.</p>",

The songs of John Hartford, Hank Williams, Dock Boggs, and The Band share space with the fiddle tunes of Eck Robertson and Ed Haley.

Or whether in fact, to put the kettle on, crack open the Hobnobs and simply yield?</p><p>Drawing on Joyce, Proust and the career of Philip Schofield to make sense of his own tangled past and possible future, Evans skilfully weaves comedy, pathos and narrowly averted cancellation into an unforgettable two hours of unique entertainment.</p><p><em>“A typically amazing show… Masterful really. There’s no one quite like him.”&nbsp;</em>Dan Jackson, @Northumbriana.</p><p><em>“An incredibly heartfelt and, of course, bloody funny evening.”&nbsp;</em>Duncan Wainscott, @folkyvale.</p><p><em>“Still ruminating on an incredible night of storytelling/ comedy with Simon Evans last night – real genius in the elegiac tales woven perfectly through the sharp humour.”</em>&nbsp;Mike Rea, @IdeaPharma</p><p><em>“We saw you last night at Tiverton. A 100-mile round trip and worth every foot of it. What an amazing show. Humour and pathos. A rare and beautiful thing.

After a few moves and a temporary closure during the Second World War, the community known as Scunthorpe Baptist Church found its home on Ashby Road.\n\nAlmost exactly a century after that first service the members of the church made the audacious and bold decision to close and reopen as ‘Connect Church’; a new venture built from the ground up to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century world.",

I started fitness quite late on in life doing the initial training with my daughter as she didn’t want to do it on her own and from then on I was hooked and have never looked back.\n\nWell firstly my participants are my priority and I understand that to enjoy a class you need to feel welcome and safe; you need to know its ok if the class is moving in one direction and you’re going in the other its fine. Everybody does it so you’re not the first and won’t be the last.\n\nI think my classes have been popular for so many years is because they are fun, hey even I go wrong but we can laugh about it.\n\nIts important you work at a level that feels good for you and you are in an environment that allows this.\n\nI know there are barriers to fitness for many people but hopefully the classes can help remove some of those for you and leave you feeling empowered and crush any doubts you may had about yourself and abilities.",

Since the gallery’s doors first opened in 2001 we have developed a reputation for offering a varied and exciting exhibition programme of contemporary art, craft and design.  We show around 20 exhibitions per year, across six exhibition spaces, and aim to be as ambitious and creatively diverse.  As well as bringing arts and culture to the local community, we aim to exhibit art by groups that are traditionally under represented in mainstream galleries.\n\nEncompassing a wide range of media, subjects and artistic approaches, we present a mixture of in-house curated exhibitions, touring shows and exhibitions developed in partnership with fellow creative organisations.  We also produce and deliver our own touring exhibitions to other galleries nationally, and offer an extensive education programme for all ages and abilities.\n\nWe’re an Arts Council England [National Portfolio Organisation (NPO] which means funding thanks to tax payers and National Lottery players plays a huge part in supporting our work.",

    "description": "<p>Days of the Supergroup may be long past… but The Guilty Men would surely qualify for that description! The band is made up of five of the finest musicians from the Northwest of England. Between them, they have played over 10,000 gigs on planet Earth, recorded thousands of songs and made countless radio and TV appearances. To say they’re experienced would be an understatement!</p><p>The story starts in 1979, in Manchester, England. Clive Gregson and Neil Cossar met through a mutual friend, John Martin, the bassist in The Cheaters… Neil was the band’s guitarist. Clive was the leader of Any Trouble. The Cheaters had a PA, Any Trouble owned a van. It made sense to pool resources, often with both bands on the same bill… happy days!</p><p>Any Trouble signed to Stiff Records, The Cheaters signed to EMI. Both bands released several albums and played thousands of shows. Both bands ran their course… Clive then went on to a successful partnership with singer Christine Collister, released over 20 solo albums, and spent 15 years in Nashville working as a session musician and producer. Neil became a radio DJ, formed a Music PR company and launched the online brand This Day in Music, before becoming a music book publisher.</p><p>Cut to 2021… lifelong friends Clive and Neil are catching up over lunch and thought it might be fun to try and write some songs together… Several weeks and quite a few songs later, they decided to expand the enterprise from a songwriting workshop to a full blown band. Clive recruited keyboardist Jez Smith and bassist Craig Fletcher from John Lees’ Barclay James Harvest… and the lineup was completed with the addition of legendary drummer, Paul Burgess, who has played with 10cc since 1973. They named the band The Guilty Men… and headed into the recording studio.</p><p>Cut to 2024… and The Guilty Men’s debut album “Invisible Confetti” is ready to roll. 13 brand new songs recorded in the old-fashioned way: everybody playing live in the studio, intent on catching the moment. Most of the songs were laid down in no more than two&nbsp;or three&nbsp;takes… and with four featured lead vocalists, the album covers a lot of musical bases. “Invisible Confetti” rocks… with nods to Americana, country, folk, pop, psychedelia… it’s an exhilarating ride from start to finish. All aboard!</p><p>Tickets £15/£17 OTD</p><p>Book via Ropery Hall website</p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\">The Hospital Players, established in 1943, are the longest-running amateur dramatics group in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Over the years, they have staged over 230 productions. They perform two shows a year at the Plowright Theatre, showcasing a variety of plays and productions. </span></span></span><br></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"></span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><strong>When rehearsing for a production, the group aims to meet 2-3 times a week between 7.30pm - 9.30pm however the days are interchangeable and depends on the availability of the cast and crew.&nbsp;Please contact the group directly for more information on rehearsal and performance times.</strong> </span></span></span><br></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\">Known for their friendly and welcoming atmosphere, the group encourages members to participate both on and off stage. From acting and directing to set design and costume making, there are numerous opportunities for members to contribute and develop new skills.</span></span></span><br></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\">Being part of an amateur dramatics society like The Hospital Players offers numerous benefits, particularly for mental health. Engaging in creative activities such as acting and stage production can significantly reduce stress and anxiety by providing a constructive outlet for emotions. The sense of community and teamwork fosters strong social connections, which are crucial for emotional well-being. Additionally, the process of learning lines, rehearsing, and performing can boost self-confidence and provide a sense of accomplishment. Overall, participating in amateur dramatics can enhance mental health and well-being through creativity, social interaction, and personal growth.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\">There is much more to do in an amateur dramatics society than just acting. Members can get involved in set design, creating the visual backdrop for the performances, which can be a highly rewarding and creative endeavour. Working on props involves crafting and sourcing items that bring authenticity to the play, stimulating creativity and problem-solving skills. Lighting and sound are crucial for setting the mood and enhancing the audience’s experience, requiring technical skills and precision. Working backstage, managing the flow of the performance, and ensuring everything runs smoothly can be incredibly fulfilling. Each of these roles provides a sense of purpose and achievement, contributing to mental well-being by fostering a sense of belonging, enhancing self-esteem, and offering a productive way to channel energy and creativity.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin-bottom:11px\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"line-height:107%\"><span style=\"font-family:Aptos,sans-serif\"><b>Backstage

      "description": "The Hospital Players are the longest running amateur dramatic group in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, originally opening the tabs in 1943.\n \nThe Hospital Players currently put on 3 shows a year at Scunthorpe's Plowright Theatre. We are a very friendly amateur dramatics group. As a group we pride ourselves on giving the best performances possible, but we think it's very important to have fun along the way! 2023 marks the 80th anniversary of our first production, The Admirable Crichton. You can learn all about our interesting history here.\n\n The Hospital Players rehearse at the Grange Farm Community Centre in Scunthorpe. Putting on a play involves so much more than rehearsing a script. As a group we design and build our own sets; design, record and edit our own sound and lighting plot. We write, film and edit our own trailers, design the posters, source and sometimes make the costumes, and so much more! There are plenty of things to get involved with on and off the stage, and we always welcome new members to the group.\n\nSo if you are 16+ and looking to join a fun, exciting and friendly group then look no further. You can be as involved as you want to be! If you are interested in becoming a Hospital Player please visit the Contact part of the website.",

Health is at the heart of it, but psychology has a role to play as well, and we need to have that feeling of looking good.\n\n\nNew Beginnings brings together a range of services for mind, body and wellness to help our clients be fit and well inside and out. The best way to great health is to look after the whole body, not just the physical aspects but also the mental issues as well; as the saying goes \"Healthy Body, Healthy Mind\".\n\n\nLooking after your health as a whole package is so important, yet it is something that far too many people sadly neglect.  Our range of services has been put together in such a way that many of them complement each other.\n\n\nOur fully equipped personal training studio allows clients to work out in comfort and privacy. In addition this allows clients to also benefit from the expert advice of our personal trainers either with one-to-one support based on their individual goals or small group classes such as yoga.\n\n\nOur New Beginnings founder is also qualified in nutrition and is available to put together the best possible programme to assist with weight loss, fitness issues and helping to create a health body. For those clients who have issues with food, we can assist with this. Helping you to create a more positive and healthier person both on the outside and as well as on the inside can give you the real boost of confidence that can be invaluable in both a professional and personal capacity. \n\nFrom counselling to life coaching, our highly professional team can help you to overcome whatever it is that is preventing you from achieving your goals.",

      "description": "Men’s Sheds are part of an international movement which started in Australia during the 1990’s aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of men. You can now find hundreds of Sheds across the UK, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand, USA and Ireland as well as Australia.\n\nThe main purpose of Men’s Sheds is to help us remain connected after we retire, if we become unemployed, if we are bereaved, or when we are facing difficult times in our lives. We may simply be looking for something to do and a place to go where we can have a laugh, enjoy a bit of banter, drink copious amounts of tea and eat too many biscuits.\nOne of our members, age (well over) 80 years, said “Coming to the Shed is better than any Doctors prescription.”\n\nMen’s Sheds are probably much more than you expected, especially if you thought, as many do, that we work out of garden sheds. Our Sheds come in all shapes and sizes and are for people over the age of 18. \n\nThe Shed on The Isle is a new Shed joining several others across the area.  It is based on the site of Thurlow Pavillion, Station Road, Epworth.\n\nIt is not fully open yet, there is an open day planned for 23rd February 10am - 4pm. Come along and see all the wonderful things that will be on offer when it is a fully functional Shed!\n\nhttps://www.meninshedshumber.co.uk/images/shop/more/636x900_37_4d4d5f60abdb78756ec73e728a050bc4_1673360011Shedopenday.jpeg",

But no matter who’s training or what we’ve had to train with, our goal has remained the same – to provide our community of Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire with the finest Martial Arts education we can offer.\n\nWe are blessed to have an incredible team of dedicated instructors including Master grades in both our key martial arts.\n\nAt the core of the team Master Smith and wife Lisa Smith work to maintain the family values of the school. Although several of the instructors share the Smith surname it is only coincidence.\n\nMost of our instructors joined Twin Tigers to follow their own path many years ago and have since decided to share the life skills and benefits they found with others.\n\nTwin Tigers is dedicated to developing our students, through a martial arts education.\n\nOur instruction team work tirelessly to get the best out of each student. We ensure that our student’s progression is earned, never given. No matter the skill level or ability, we tailor our student’s experiences to secure the best Martial Arts education possible, for children, adults and everyone in between, we have a class for you.\n\nWe believe not only do we have the best instruction team in the area, we also have the best facilities by far",

Our range of services has been put together in such a way that many of them complement each other.\n\n\nOur fully equipped personal training studio allows clients to work out in comfort and privacy. In addition this allows clients to also benefit from the expert advice of our personal trainers either with one-to-one support based on their individual goals or small group classes such as yoga.\n\n\nOur New Beginnings founder is also qualified in nutrition and is available to put together the best possible programme to assist with weight loss, fitness issues and helping to create a health body. For those clients who have issues with food, we can assist with this. Helping you to create a more positive and healthier person both on the outside and as well as on the inside can give you the real boost of confidence that can be invaluable in both a professional and personal capacity. \n\nFrom counselling to life coaching, our highly professional team can help you to overcome whatever it is that is preventing you from achieving your goals.",

They will do this in a way that provides for the future challenges. As one of 38 Rural Community Councils across the country, we will be there to stimulate their thinking, support their work and help turn their aspirations into reality.\n\nThere are around 11,000 rural communities across Britain ranging from small hamlets to bustling market towns, all with their own individual character and economy. However, rural communities now find themselves at a cross-roads and action is essential in order to generate more sustainable communities and lifestyles, offering a better quality of life for all who live in the countryside, not just the affluent who can afford to live there.\n\nWith global pressures such as climate change, an ageing population and long lasting constraints on public spending, it is time to generate a new vision for our rural communities that delivers better services in different ways. Only then can we provide for the needs of both current and future generations that live, work and play in the countryside.",

Timid students transform into warriors, students becoming trainers and a whole lot of changes at our venue. But no matter who’s training or what we’ve had to train with, our goal has remained the same – to provide our community of Scunthorpe and North Lincolnshire with the finest Martial Arts education we can offer.\n\nWe are blessed to have an incredible team of dedicated instructors including Master grades in both our key martial arts.\n\nAt the core of the team Master Smith and wife Lisa Smith work to maintain the family values of the school. Although several of the instructors share the Smith surname it is only coincidence.\n\nMost of our instructors joined Twin Tigers to follow their own path many years ago and have since decided to share the life skills and benefits they found with others.\n\nTwin Tigers is dedicated to developing our students, through a martial arts education.\n\nOur instruction team work tirelessly to get the best out of each student. We ensure that our student’s progression is earned, never given. No matter the skill level or ability, we tailor our student’s experiences to secure the best Martial Arts education possible, for children, adults and everyone in between, we have a class for you.\n\nWe believe not only do we have the best instruction team in the area, we also have the best facilities by far",

One of the core proposals from the paper was to fund new Mental Health Support Teams, which are predominantly being supervised by NHS Children and Young People’s Mental Health Services as well as local charity/private services.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that the Mental Health Support Teams reach those most in need of the support; presently we are a working in selected educational settings across Doncaster, Rotherham and North Lincolnshire. Part of this initiative also offers support to those students not in mainstream education and includes working in some Doncaster and North Lincolnshire Special Education Schools, Doncaster Home Educated Pupils and to pupils attending certain Alternative Provisions in Rotherham and North Lincolnshire.",

I started fitness quite late on in life doing the initial training with my daughter as she didn’t want to do it on her own and from then on I was hooked and have never looked back.\n\nWell firstly my participants are my priority and I understand that to enjoy a class you need to feel welcome and safe; you need to know its ok if the class is moving in one direction and you’re going in the other its fine. Everybody does it so you’re not the first and won’t be the last.\n\nI think my classes have been popular for so many years is because they are fun, hey even I go wrong but we can laugh about it.\n\nIts important you work at a level that feels good for you and you are in an environment that allows this.\n\nI know there are barriers to fitness for many people but hopefully the classes can help remove some of those for you and leave you feeling empowered and crush any doubts you may had about yourself and abilities.",

Always a student and recently became a Sound Therapist after studying with the British Academy Of Sound Therapy.\nI’m passionate about promoting healing, vitality and wellbeing through the practice of yoga and sound.\n\n“I stumbled upon yoga unexpectedly”\n\nIt all began because I was overwhelmed with work, working through grief, my body stiff, self esteem low, struggling with weight gain and was experiencing huge hormonal shifts. I was feeling completely lost and my health and wellbeing was deteriorating.\n\nI needed change, and so joined a gym and quickly realised it wasn’t my cup of tea! I was about to give up when I discovered  yoga classes on the timetable. \n\nI remember my first class, sat on a yoga mat thinking what am I doing here, I can’t even touch my toes...never in a million years would I have known that day would change my life..\n\n The stretching felt so good, and with practice the stillness of my mind and body in relaxation became a welcome gift, a huge wake up call to self care!!",

      "description": "Imagine a collective of unpaid carers of people with dementia with the advocacy skills, knowledge and passion for making positive change for everyone impacted by dementia. Thanks to the work of tide, you don’t have to imagine. Tide works side by side with carers to ensure that their voices are heard. The foundations of tide were born out of the daily struggle that a group of women experienced in looking after family members with dementia. They decided that they did not want their experiences to become a reality for future carers. Out of this powerful commitment, tide the charity was born.  \n\nHere at tide, we walk alongside carers. Every step of the way.  All that we do is grounded in the experience of the thousands of carers we have worked with over the years. We are continually inspired by the courageous people who come forward to add their voice to a growing movement. We see their confidence grow and lives change as carers realise the powerful impact of their voices. This is what motivates us. This is what keeps us moving forward.  \n\nWhether you are a current or former carer of someone with dementia, or a professional working with carers, tide is here for you. Join us and let's make the world a better place for everyone living with dementia in the UK.",
